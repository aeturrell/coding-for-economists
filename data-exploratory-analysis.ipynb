It also *seems* like the number of `Baths` column has some data issues because it is a floating point number rather than an integer. However, this a North American quirk: realtors refer to bathrooms with only a toilet and sink as a \"half bath\" (and sometimes those with a shower but no bathtub as a \"three-quarter bath,\" which also shows up in the data).

If you need to use something from this section, you probably still can: *coding for economists* has a huge number of dependencies, much more than a normal project, and this particular problem may not affect you. If you want to help, you can show your support for a resolution on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling/issues/1456)—though please do bear in mind that most open source libraries are run by volunteers, and you should always be constructive in your interactions. The second is to contribute to the library yourself by creating a pull request that fixes the problem.\n",

The [**ydata-profiling**](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/) library aims to automate the legwork of EDA for you. It generates 'profile' reports from a pandas DataFrame. For each column, many statistics are computed and then relayed in an interactive HTML report.\n",

You should also know where to go for more in-depth, heavy duty exploratory data analysis reports, namely **ydata-profiling** and **dataprep**."
