It also *seems* like the number of `Baths` column has some data issues because it is a floating point number rather than an integer. However, this a North American quirk: realtors refer to bathrooms with only a toilet and sink as a \"half bath\" (and sometimes those with a shower but no bathtub as a \"three-quarter bath,\" which also shows up in the data).

There isn't much difference between them in general apart from it seems like **dataprep** has slightly better support for string column types (check out the details of `Address` below) and is a little bit richer on visualisations (it has interactive plots that you can change the axes of-look at the interactions page below).\n",

You should know now how to do simple analysis of **pandas** dataframes using techniques from other chapters to create summary statistics, using styling of tables of summary statistics, and using the quick visualisation options that are built-in to **pandas**. You should also know where to go for more in-depth, heavy duty exploratory data analysis reports, namely **pandas-profiling** and **dataprep**."
