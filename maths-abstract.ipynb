It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation) via grad as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily to any order.\n",

    "### Just-in-time compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "The other nice feature of **jax** is the ability to do just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Because they do not compile their code into machine-code before running, high-level languages like Python and R are not as fast as the same code written in C++ or Fortran (the benefit is that it takes you less time to write the code in the first place). Much of the time, there are pre-composed functions that call C++ under the hood to do these things--but only for those operations that people have already taken the time to code up in a lower level language. JIT compilation offers a compromise: you can code more or less as you like in the high-level language but it will be compiled just-in-time to give you a speed-up!\n",
    "\n",
    "**jax** is certainly not the only Python package that does this, and if you're not doing anything like differentiating or propagating, **numba** is a more mature alternative. But here we'll see the time difference for JIT compilation on an otherwise slow operation: element wise multiplication and addition."
