    "Basic number arithmetic is achieved by `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `**` (powers), `%` (modulo), and `@` (tensor product). Most of these functions don't need a huge amount of explanation because you'll be familiar with them already (and you can look up the others when you do need them).\n",

    "When you have two numeric columns of equal length and you add or subtract them, it's pretty obvious what's going to happen. But we do need to talk about what happens when there is a variable involved that is *not* as long as the column. This is important for operations like `flights.assign(air_time = air_time / 60)` because there are 336,776 numbers on the left of `/` but only one on the right. In this case, **pandas** will understand that you'd like to divide *all* values of air time by 60. This is sometimes called 'broadcasting'.

    "## More Useful Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how useful `.mean()`, `.count()`, and `.value_counts()` can be for analysis. **pandas** has a great many more built-in summary statistics functions, however. These include `.median()` (you may find it interesting to compare the mean vs the median when looking at the hourly departure delay in the flights data), `.mode()`, `.min()`, and `.max()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class of useful summary statistics are provided by the `.quantile()` function, which is the same as `median()` for `.quantile(0.5)`. The quantile at x% is the value that x% of values are below. (Note that under this definition, `.quantile(1)` will be the same as `.max()`.) Let's see an example with the 25th percentile."

    "It's worth remembering that all of the summary statistics described above are a way of reducing the distribution down to a single number. This means that they're fundamentally reductive, and if you pick the wrong summary, you can easily miss important differences between groups. That's why it's always a good idea to visualise the distribution of values as well as using aggregate statistics.\n",

On the former, it's very hard to see any pattern except that there's a very large spike around zero, the bars rapidly decay in height, and for most of the plot, you can't see any bars because they are too short to see. On the latter, where we've discarded delays of greater than two hours, we can see that the spike occurs slightly below zero (i.e. most flights leave a couple of minutes early), but there's still a very steep decay after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't be afraid to explore your own custom summaries specifically tailored for the data that you're working with. In this case, that might mean separately summarising the flights that left early vs the flights that left late, or given that the values are so heavily skewed, you might try a log-transformation. Finally, don't forget that it's always a good idea to include the number of observations in each group when creating summaries."
