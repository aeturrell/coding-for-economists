Quadtree is not a replacement for the latter, because the data are already aggregated. But, if you have point data, quadtree allows you to aggregate them *not* according to a pre-defined geography.

    "Now we will create the small multiple chart. There's quite a lot going on in the below so let's talk through the moving pieces. There's a perpectually uniform heatmap from the **colorcet** package that ranges between a min of 0 and max of 250 as set by `vmin` and `vmax`. To plot every one of the 12 time periods, `plt.subplots` is called with `nrows=4` and `ncols=3` for 12 axes in total. We `.flatten()` the axes to make it easier to iterate over them. We turn the legend off for all but one axis. With all of this set up, we iterate through the unique values of the date column, which is at monthly frequency, and plot each in turn on a separate axis oject. For each, we also add a title that is the month and year.\n",
