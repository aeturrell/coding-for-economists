Enter different basemaps, ie different backgrounds for you to draw the geospatial data on top of.\n",

But the whole point is that we can combine this map with other things, so we'll do a few points to show where some places are: LLandudno, Cardiff, Rhyll, Newport, and St Davids. St Davids is the smallest city in Britain, and we'll make the points proportional to population, so you may have to squint to see it!"
