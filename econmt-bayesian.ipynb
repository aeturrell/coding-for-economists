    "In the next chapter, we'll look at an easier way to do Bayesian inference in Python, but you'll find life easier overall if you start here. We'll also use [**ArviZ**](https://arviz-devs.github.io/) for visualisation of the results from Bayesian inference, a package that builds on **Matplotlib**, but this will get automatically installed when you install **PyMC**. You should follow the install instructions for **PyMC** and **Bambi** carefully and, if you're confident with using different Python environments, it's a good idea to spin up a new 'bayes' environment to try them out in. In case you need a refresher, the chapter on {ref}`code-preliminaries` covers basic information on how to install new packages.\n",

    "The expert Bayesian may wonder, \"why these packages?\" There are many others available, even just in Python. One reason is that they're simpler to use for beginners while having enormous power for advanced users too, so they're very much in keeping with Python's low floor, high ceiling style. The other is that they're considerably more mature than some of the more recent alternatives based on popular tensor and machine learning packages (though **PyMC** is also built on an underlying tensor package). Finally, they also have flexible computing back-ends (including Jax and Numba, and including using GPUs), which means that super users can make their models go *extremely fast* should they need to—you can find more information on the speed-ups that are possible [here](https://www.pymc-labs.io/blog-posts/pymc-stan-benchmark/).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference between the Bayesian and frequentist approaches (that we've seen in the other chapters) is probably that, in Bayesian models, the parameters are not assumed to be fixed but instead are treated as random variables whose uncertainty is described using probability distributions. The data are considered fixed. You might see the 'inverse probability' formulation of a Bayesian model written as $p(\\theta | y)$ where the $y$ are the data, and the $\\theta$ are the model parameters. An interesting aspect of Bayesianism is that there is just one estimator: Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a contrast with the frequentist view, which holds that the data are random but the model parameters are fixed, and models are often expressed as functions, for example $f(y | \\theta)$. Frequentist inference typically involves deriving estimators for the model parameters, and these are usually created to minimise the bias, minimise the variance, or maximise the efficiency. Not so with Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, Bayes' theorem says that ${\\displaystyle p(A\\mid B)={\\frac {p(B\\mid A)p(A)}{p(B)}}}$, where $A$ and $B$ are distinct events, $p(A)$ is the probability of event $A$ happening, and $p(A\\mid B)$ is the probability of $A$ happening given $B$ has happened or is true. $p$ could stand in for a single number, a probability density function, or a probability mass function. When dealing with data and model parameters, and ignoring a rescaling factor, this can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p({\\boldsymbol{\\theta }}|{\\boldsymbol{y}})\\propto p({\\boldsymbol{y}}|{\\boldsymbol{\\theta }})p({\\boldsymbol{\\theta }}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $p({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$ is the prior put on model parameters—what we think the distribution of model parameters will look like.\n",
    "2. $p({\\boldsymbol{y}}|{\\boldsymbol{\\theta }})$ is the likelihood of this data given a particular set of model parameters.\n",
    "3. $p({\\boldsymbol{\\theta }}|{\\boldsymbol{y}})$ is the posterior probability of model parameters given the observed data.\n",

    "\n",
    "One key strength of the Bayesian approach is that it preserves uncertainty—by construction, it includes the degree of belief you have in a parameter. This makes it especially useful in cases where uncertainty is important because the uncertainties are propagated all the through to the final results. One disadvantage of the Bayesian approach is that it's not always as fast and doesn't always scale well to very large datasets.\n",

    "The methods used to do this are all some variation on the *Monte Carlo* method, a tool that goes much wider than Bayesian inference. Monte Carlo techniques use random numbers to choose samples that allow you to estimate properties of interest. It can be used to perform numerical integration and is used for discrete particle simulations in fields like physics and chemistry. {cite:t}`rubinstein2016simulation` provides a good introduction to the Monte Carlo methods more broadly, including simulation; {cite:t}`bielajew2001fundamentals` is a very good free textbook on Monte Carlo methods for particle transport physics.\n",

    "Say we wanted to compute the integral of a 2D shape, a circle, to get an area. In the figure above, random pairs of numbers (say, $x, y$) are chosen within the unit square. By taking the ratio of the number of points that land within the 2D shape (40) to all samples (50), we can get an approximation of the area by computing (area of square) x ratio of samples $= 3.2 \\approx \\pi$. This type of algorithm is a form of Monte Carlo rejection sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Chain Monte Carlo takes this a step further. A Markov Chain is a stochastic process where the chance of being in a particular state (for example, taking a particular sample) depends only on the previous state. These have equilibrium distributions; essentially a long-run average distribution over states. Markov Chain Monte Carlo finds the distribution you're after (the posterior) by recording states from the chain; the more steps, the more closely the distribution of samples will match the distribution you're trying to find out about. There are nice walkthroughs of MCMC available [here](https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/MCMC.html#markov-chain-monte-carlo-mcmc), [here](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bayes_Computing_Course/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_1-MCMC.ipynb), and [here](https://rlhick.people.wm.edu/stories/bayesian_3.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms for undertaking MCMC, with perhaps the most famous being the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. For this, we have a probability density function to sample from, a function $Q$ that quantifies where to make a transition, and $\\theta_0$, the first guess of the parameters. Starting from $\\theta = \\theta_0$, the algorithm boils down to:\n",
    "1. starting from this point $\\theta$, determine its match with the target distribution by estimating $p = p({\\boldsymbol{y}}|{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})p({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$\n",
    "2. propose a new sample, $\\theta'$, using some transition function $Q$, and check its match to the target (let this match be $p'$)\n",
    "3. compute the ratio of densities, $\\frac{p'}{p}$, as a metric of favourability of the new point\n",
    "4. generate a random number $r \\thicksim \\mathcal{U}[0, 1)$ and compare it to the ratio; accept the new point only if $r < \\frac{p'}{p}$\n",
    "5. repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "The clever trick here is that, over time and with more samples, the points you draw will be from the target (posterior) distribution because, at each loop, we are forcing the samples to stick to the posterior distribution. The set of samples is often called a trace. You can find a nice walkthrough of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with code, [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-scratch-bayesian-inference-markov-chain-monte-carlo-and-metropolis-hastings-in-python-ef21a29e25a).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a good place to start to understand what's going on in computational Bayesian inference, but there are more modern and powerful algorithms available today, most notably Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which takes its inspiration from physics (where the Hamiltonian is an operator that returns the total energy of the system). Instead of sampling completely randomly, which can be inefficient, HMC sees the sampler get 'rolled' (launched in a smooth trajectory) along the estimates of the posterior. There's a very good explanation of this approach [here](https://elevanth.org/blog/2017/11/28/build-a-better-markov-chain/), and a 'conceptual introduction to HMC' may be found in {cite:t}`betancourt2018conceptual`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used HMC sampler is the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), and this is what we'll be using for most of our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this chapter, you won't need to worry about most of this though! The joy of **PyMC** and **Bambi** is that they take care of some of the hard work for us. Expert users will want to dig further into the details, but these packages make running your first Bayesian inference easier with sensible default settings."

    "## Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "This section has benefitted from [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://nbviewer.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/tree/master/) and the [prior choice recommendations page](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations) of the Stan wiki.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "While **Bambi** (which we'll come to shortly) will choose priors for you, you can override them—and there are many situations where you may wish to do this. And for **PyMC**, you always have to specify your priors. But how do you choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important paradigms to be aware of when choosing priors: *objective* priors, where the data influence the posterior the most, and *subjective* priors, where the economist expresses their views in the form of the prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quintessential example of an *objective prior* is the flat prior, literally a uniform distribution over the entire possible range of the variable that is to be estimated. By choosing this, you are saying that you put equal weight on all possible values. You would very rarely use this in practice, and priors with soft boundaries are generally preferred over those with hard boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *subjective* or *informative* prior, however, would have more probability density or mass on certain values, biasing the final estimate toward that part of the range. You might use this if there were lots of previous evidence for something, or if there were extra information outside of the model that you wanted to incorporate. An informative prior reflects a higher degree of certainty about where the final values might end up, and will take a stronger pull to overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inbetween these two extremes are weakly informative priors, which are the default in **Bambi** and a good place to start in **PyMC** models, especially if your data are appropriately normalised.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen some handy priors such as the normal distribution, half-normal distribution, and Student-t distribution (plus it's half equivalent too). You can find a full list of priors supported by **PyMC** [here](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/api/distributions.html), in the section on distributions. Some priors to check out are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cauchy and half-Cauchy\n",
    "- Beta\n",
    "- Gamma\n",
    "- Binomial (discrete)\n",
    "- Bernoulli (discrete)\n",
    "- Poisson (discrete)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a generic prior as a place to start for anything, some people recommend $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ or $\\text{Student-t}(3,0,1)$, assuming your data is appropriately normalised and could be negative or positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim to keep all the parameters in your model \"scale-free\". This means adjusting them so that a unit increase is meaningful. This will help in numerous ways, including giving a chance for priors like $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ or $\\mathcal{N}(0, 10)$ to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some suggested ways of scaling your data could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scale by the standard deviation of the data via $x \\longrightarrow x/\\sigma_{x}$, for example, if you were looking at test scores you might divide by the standard deviation of all the test scores.\n",
    "- In a regression, take logs of (positive-constrained) predictors and outcomes, then the coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities, $x \\longrightarrow \\ln x$\n",
    "- If a variable has a typical value, say 4, then scale by that under a logarithm, $x \\longrightarrow \\ln(x/4)$"
