    "\n",
    "Let's get the jargon and definitions out of the way first, then we'll find out a bit about random numbers in code, then we'll actually see how to *use* for probability!\n",
    "\n",
    "Any probabilistic event can be considered to have three components: the sample space of possible outcomes $\\Omega$, the set of possible events $\\mathcal{F}$, and a probability measure $P$. Furthermore, $A$ is often used to denote a subset of $\\Omega$ and $A^c$ the complement of $A$, while individual events in $\\Omega$ are $\\omega$. In the classic example of rolling a 6-sided fair die once, $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. If $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ then, by definition of $\\Omega$, $A^c = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$. The probability measure of any sample space satisfies $P(\\Omega)=1$ and $P(\\varnothing)$ = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important examples of probability that arise in economics are **continuous random variables** and **discrete random variables**. A random variable is a function $X: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega: X(w) \\leq x\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ for each $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$. All this is saying is that for every possible outcome, the random variable is a mapping of that outcome into a well-defined space of real numbers. It makes the connection between outcomes, events, and real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll go on to more practical matters: discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable is discrete if it only takes values in a countable subset of $\\mathbb{R}$; think the integers, or $x\\in\\{0, 1\\}$. The distribution of such values is given by the **probability mass function**, or pmf. The pmf is an object that tells us the probabilty mass given to specific outcomes. The more precise defintion is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_i) = P(X=x_i) = P(\\underbrace{\\{\\omega\\in \\Omega\\ |\\ X(\\omega) = x_i\\}}_{\\text{set of outcomes resulting in}\\ X=x_i}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a few key properties. $p:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow [0, 1]$, the probability of all outcomes sum to 1, ie $\\displaystyle{\\sum_{x_i} p(x_i)}=1$, the probabilities satisfy $p(x_i) \\geq 0  \\quad\\forall x_i$, and $P(X \\in A) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{x_i \\in A} p(x_i)$. A fair six-sided die is the canonical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful object is the **cumulative distribution function**, which is defined generally as $\\text{cdf}(x) = P(X \\leq x)\\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For probability mass functions, this becomes\n",

    "### Continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous random variables are functions such that $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow [0, \\infty)$ is a **probability density**. Probability density functions are to continuous random variables what PMFs are to discrete random variables, though there are some important differences that can trip up even the most careful. They are defined as follows: the probability of $X$ taking a value betwen $a$ and $b$ is given by\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\displaystyle\\int_a^b f(x) dx\n",

    "\n",
    "The big mistake that people sometimes make is to think that $f(x)$ is a probability but it's not! The clue is in the name; $f(x)$ is a probability *density*, while $f(x) dx$ is a probability. This means you only get a probability from $f(x)$ once you integrate it. It also means that $f(x)$ has units of $1/x$. For example, if $x$ is wages, $f(x)$ has units of $\\text{wages}^{-1}$.\n",

    "### The Monte Carlo Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo is the name of a part of Monaco that harbours a famous casino, yes, but it's also the name given to a bunch of techniques that rely on generating random numbers in order to solve problems. It's a really useful technique that entire textbooks cover and we can't hope to give it the love and attention it requires here, covering as it does Bayesian statistics, random walks, Markov switching models, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, bootstrapping, and optimisation! But what we can do is take a quick look at the very, very core code tools that can support these applications. The bottom line is that between the drawing of random variables from given **scipy** distributions we've already seen, the use of `prng.choice()`, and the use of `prng.uniform`, a lot of Monte Carlo methods are covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already covered drawing random numbers from distributions already included in **scipy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`prng.uniform` is helpful in the following case: in the (extremely unlikely) event that there isn't a pre-built distribution available for a case where you know the analytical expression of a PDF and its CDF, a quick way to get random numbers distributed according to that PDF is to plug random numbers into the inverse cumulative distribution function. ie you plug random numbers $r$ into $\\text{cdf}^{-1}(r)$ in order to generate $x \\thicksim \\text{pdf}$. The random numbers you plug in must come from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "`prng.choice()` comes into its own for simulation, one of the many applications of Monte Carlo techniques in economics. (I mean simulation loosely here; it could be an agent-based model, it could be simulating an econometric relationship.)"

    "To work out the (estimate of) probability based on the simulation, we've divided the number of throws per value by the total number of throws. You can see that with so many throws, there's quite a wedge between the chance of obtaining a six in both cases. Meanwhile, the fair die is converging to the dotted line, which is $1/6$. Note that because of the individual probabilities summing to unity, a higher probability of a six on the loaded die means that values 1 to 5 must have a lower probability than with the fair die; and you can see that emerging in the chart too.\n",
