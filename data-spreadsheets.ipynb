    "In CSV files, all values are strings. This is not particularly true to the data, but it is simple: everything is a string.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When working with spreadsheet data, it's important to keep in mind that how the underlying data is stored can be very different than what you see in the cell. For example, Excel has no notion of an integer. All numbers are stored as floating points (real number), but you can choose to display the data with a customizable number of decimal points. Similarly, dates are actually stored as numbers, specifically the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. You can customize how you display the date by applying formatting in Excel. Confusingly, it's also possible to have something that looks like a number but is actually a string (e.g. type `'10` into a cell in Excel).\n",

    "These differences between how the underlying data are stored vs. how they're displayed can cause surprises when the data are loaded into analytical tools such as **pandas**. By default, **pandas** will guess the data type in a given column.\n",
