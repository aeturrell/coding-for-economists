    "# Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers text analysis, also known as natural language processing. We'll cover tokenisation of text, removing stop words, counting words, performing other statistics on words, and analysing the parts of speech. The focus here is on English, but many of the methods-and even the libraries-are relevant to other languages too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing NLP, it's worth thinking carefully about the unit of analysis: is it a corpus, a text, a line, a paragraph, a sentence, a word, or even a character? It could also be two of these simultaneously, and working with document x token matrices is one very common way of doing NLP. Although we'll be mixing between a few of these in this chapter, thinking about what the block of text data you're working with will really help you keep track of what operations are being deployed and how they might interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case it's also useful to know, three of the most loved NLP packages are [**nltk**](https://www.nltk.org/), [**spaCy**](https://spacy.io/), and [**gensim**](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). As you progress through the chapter, you should also bear in mind that some of the methods we'll see are computationally expensive and you might want to fall back on simpler approaches, such as those seen in the previous chapter, if you have large volumes of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll use a single example and using NLP on it in a few different ways. First, though, we need to read in the text data we'll be using, part of Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations* and do some light cleaning of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we'll read in our text so that each new line appears on a different row of a **pandas** dataframe. We will end up working with it both as a vector of lines and, later, as a vector of lists of words. We'll also import the packages we'll need; remember, you may need to install these first and the Chapter on {ref}`code-preliminaries` provides a brief guide on how to do this."

Many NLP libraries come with built-in methods that remove stop words. \n",

So we must first transform the token column to a single list of all tokens and then apply `Counter()`. To achieve the former and flatten a list of lists, we'll use `itertools` chain function which makes an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until it is exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterable, until all of the iterables in all inputs are exhausted. For example, given `[a, b, c]` and `[d, e, f]` as arguments, this function would return `[a, b, c, d, e, f]`. Because this function accepts an arbitrary number of iterable arguments, we use the splat operator, aka `*`, to tell it to expect lots of different arguments.

Each document in the corpus then has a vector representation in terms of the basis vectors. A consequence is that there is a sensible inner vector product defined on the space. As a demonstration, let's look for the line in the book that is closest to the title according to this vector space. The vector for the first line is just the first row in $X$. We take the argmax of the inner product with all of the *other* line vectors to find the entry in `X` that maximises the inner product."

Let's take a look at at a package that can compute a wide range of them, [**textstat**](https://github.com/shivam5992/textstat). We'll see what it can do with English, but it supports other languages too. And we won't use all of its measures, just a few of the most well-known.\n",
