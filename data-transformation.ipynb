    "The previous chapter showed how to access different parts of a dataframe and create new rows or columns. In this chapter, you'll learn how to do more interesting transformations of data including aggregations and groupbys.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is hugely indebted to the fantastic [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake Vanderplas. Remember, if you get stuck with **pandas**, there is brilliant [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) and a fantastic set of [introductory tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) on the **pandas** website. These notes are heavily indebted to those introductory tutorials.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter uses the **pandas** and **numpy** packages. If you're running this code, you may need to install these packages, which you can do using either `conda install packagename` or `pip install packagename` on your computer's command line. If you're running this page in Google Colab, you can install new packages by running `!pip install packagename` in a new code cell but you will need to restart the Colab notebook for the change to take effect. There's a brief guide on installing packages in the Chapter on {ref}`code-preliminaries`. Remember, you only need to install them once!"
