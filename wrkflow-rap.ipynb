    "# Reproducible Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will tell you about reproducible analysis and what are sometimes called \"reproducible analytical pipelines\", also known as RAPs. This chapter has benefitted from the \"[Quality Assurance of Code for Analysis and Research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance)\" book produced by the Best Practice and Impact division of the Office for National Statistics and \"The Turing Way\", a [guide to reproducibility](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app) produced by the Alan Turing Institute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people in a lot of different contexts. Here, we're going to think about the reproducibility of analysis performed by code. That excludes external validity and although it might include robust coding practices, it doesn't include robustness checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does include Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs), which are automated analytical processes. At their best, RAPs use elements of software engineering best practice to ensure that analysis is reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different levels and aspects of reproducibile analysis with code, which we will step through in the rest of this chapter, but they form a hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- modular code\n",
    "- sensible, isolated project structure using relative filepaths\n",
    "- an unmodified version of the raw data is retained; outputs can be regenerated\n",
    "- operations should form a reproducible analytical pipeline\n",
    "- the reproducible analytical pipeline can be automatically executed (eg using Make or a 'main' script)\n",
    "- code language is reproducible (eg `Python=3.10.6` in pyproject.toml file)\n",
    "- code language packages are reproducible (eg `pandas=2.2.3` in pyproject.toml file)\n",
    "- code language packages' dependencies are reproducible (eg that pandas depends on `numpy=1.26.4` in this installation is recorded somewhere)\n",
    "- operating system is reproducible (as specified in a Docker file or by using repo2docker)\n",
    "\n",
    "*A lot of the value to be had in reproducible code can be achieved by just the first five*. Nailing all but the last one is a high standard and probably the right spot in the trade-off between effort and reproducibility for a lot of projects. If you get this far, you're doing a really great job. Doing all of these is the gold standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility isn't just about ensuring your results reproduce, though that's obviously the main reason to do it. It's also about saving you time and effort. This image, from biological psychiatry researcher Daniel Quintana's [talk](http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DZTVQ) *Five things about open and reproducible science that every early career researcher should know*, sums it up nicely:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick tour through this example project's structure, all of which sits in the \"project\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have the README.md, a file full of instructions in a simple text format called *markdown* (=\".md\"). Markdown is kind of like a code language for text and is commonly used to write information in coding projects. It can be \"rendered\" (that is, can be displayed not as code but in a form that is intended to be read) by Visual Studio Code using the markdown all in one extension (see the {ref}`code-where` chapter for more on markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next file, \"requirements.txt\", is one we'll be seeing much more of later in this chapter. For now, all you need to do know is that it is a list of all of the Python packages needed to run the project. Sometimes it might be called \"environment.yml\" instead, or sometimes \"pyproject.toml\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have the data, which is the data as you received it, no matter how poor the format (wishful thinking in this example that it might be a clean csv file and not 400 Excel files!). A really important principle here is that **you should not alter raw data** as it comes to you, but instead treat it as read-only. This is so that you can always trace a path from the raw data you began with to the finished product. Incoming data can and does change surprisingly often so if someone else were to do the \"same\" analysis as you and find a different answer, you want to be able to rule out starting with different input datasets as the cause. Or you may find that your data cleaning script needs adjusting, and you need to repeat all of the operations in your project. Or other good reasons. Always keep a copy of the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next folder is \"src\", which is short for \"source code\", and it's where your code scripts (.py files) or possibly Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) live. These are nicely separated into the functions they perform: cleaning the data, performing the analysis, and summarising the analysis into figures and tables (also known as floats). The other script, \"utilities.py\", might be imported as module that all of the other scripts can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from running the first two scripts are in the \"results\" folder. First we have a file that saves the results from the intermediate step of the cleaning the data (courtesy of running \"data_cleaning.py\"), then we have the results from \"analysis.py\", the derived data. Derived data might be, for example, the final tabular dataset that you use for a regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is outputs, which is split into \"latex\" and \"floats\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Latex is a typesetting language that is used for writing reports, slides, journal articles, and more. Importantly for coding and replicability, it can be automated (in a way that, say, Word can't be). Another option here would be markdown, which can also be exported to a wide variety of output formats. The text in a Latex report has to be written, we can't automate that (yet), but the figures and tables that are generated by the \"generate_plots_and_tables.py\" script can be automatically inserted. The same goes for slides written in a variant of Latex called Beamer. You can find more information on the process of automating research outputs in the chapter on {ref}`auto-research-outputs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats means, here at least, tables and figures. These also live in the outputs directory, and are put there by the \"generate_plots_and_tables.py\" script.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the structure. There is another important principle here, which follows on from the first: **you should be able to dispose of the results, figures, and tables (ie delete them), without worrying**. If you are working on a project and deleting any outputs that are generated by code scripts would scupper everything, then your project is not reproducible. (This is another reason why you should always keep an \"untouched\" version of the raw data.) If it's feasible to do so time-wise, it is good practice to delete and regenerate your outputs regularly to test that your project is indeed reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course, many variations on this example project structure. You can find \"cookiecutter\" templates out there that will help you structure your own project (some involve answering some questions about what you need, and what you'd like to call project, and so on), or just get inspiration. Some good templates to check out that can help you structure your project are the UK Government data science, [govcookiecutter](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govcookiecutter) and this comprehensive Python data science project template known as [cookiecutter-data-science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). For advanced users looking to build Python packages that others can install, the [hypermodern Python cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter-hypermodern-python.readthedocs.io/en/2021.7.15/) is packed full of amazing features and comes highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important principle of good project structure is to use relative filepaths; you can read more about those in the Chapter on {ref}`code-best-practice`."

    "## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how functions and modules can aid the reproducibility of logic. We've seen the kind of folder and file structure that can aid reproducibility of projects too. But the *order* of operations matters as well! Pipelines organise your analysis in a series of steps that, when executed, perform the same series of operations in the same order. If you arrange your code in a reproducible analytical pipelines, you will know that you can send your code to someone else and, when they run it, the same steps will be executed in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll look at the concept in general as well as some tools that can aid you in creating reproducible analytical pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first principle of RAPs may be a surprise: you shouldn't use the interactive console interactively (eg by jamming, re-running lines, etc, as you go). A RAP should be able to go from start to finish with zero human interaction during execution, and produce consistent results at the end. This is different to when you're still developing a project, and the interactive console is super useful because you're trying things out. But RAP is for prosperity and needs to work without your intervention!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directed Acyclic Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Directed acyclic graphs pop up in lots of contexts. Here, in a RAP context, we're talking about them because the execution order of your code and scripts should form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The word \"graph\" here can be confusing: it's referring to the formal notion of a graph from the branch of mathematics called graph theory, which is the study of pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) that are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A DAG is a directed graph with no directed cycles (closed loops). It consists of vertices and edges with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following the directions will never form a closed loop. To summarise: \"directed\" means that edges between nodes have a direction and you can only traverse the graph in that direction (often shown by arrows in diagrams) and \"acyclic\": means there are no cycles so that, for example, a node A can‚Äôt depend on a node B when B depends on A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is that the set of operations that are performed when following a DAG proceeds like water flowing through a series of rapids: one step after another, with no looping back.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all a bit abstract and so it's a lot easier to just take a look at a visualisation of one. We'll use the example from the previous section boiled down to only the code scripts (.py files)."

The installation instructions are different on different operating systems: you can find information on how to install Make [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). On Mac, if you use homebrew, the command to install it is `brew install make`. Similar commands exist for Linux.

    "\n",
    "First up, phony tells Make that \"all\" and \"clean\" are not the names of outputs from the project, but commands. \"all\" is defined by `all: output/report.pdf` and is the first target‚Äîwhich means that when `Make` is run without any other information, it will be called. You can see further down the page what \"all\" does: it uses the .tex file and two figures to run `pdflatex` on `report.tex`, thus compiling the latex to a pdf. (It also does some sensible moving things around in the file system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"all\" depends on the figures being there. So, if they aren't, it will run the previous two commands listed in the makefile to create them: `output/figure_1.png` and `output/figure_2.png`. These rely on the input csv data and generate_histogram.py script being present and then run the scripts (remember, telling the command line `python script.py` runs the `script.py` from top to bottom). `-i` is a flag that precedes the name of an input, but rather than type out the name of the csv again, a shorthand has been used: `$<`, which just means \"look at the first thing in the command\". `-o` is the flag that precedes the name of an output but again a shorthand is used; `$@` means use the name of the target (here `output/figure_1.png` or `output/figure_2.png`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we mentioned earlier that it's good practice to delete your ouputs and check that your RAP can re-execute and produce everything again. \"clean\" is the command that does this (via `make clean`). `rm` is command-line speak for remove, and `*` is a wildcard character that can mean anything so here it deletes `figure_1.png` and `figure_2.png` if they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the nice features of Make is that it can auto-generate the DAG that is defined in the Makefile. Here's the makefile for this example rendered as a DAG by the programme [makefile2DAG](https://github.com/lindenb/makefile2graph), which uses another tool, graphviz.\n",

    "![Directed acyclic graph of make example](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/raw/main/img/makefile_example.png)\n",

    "Another good feature is that Make doesn't care *what* programme you're using: pdflatex, python, R, whatever, *as long as you can call it from the command line*. Which is basically all programmes. So it's very flexible too.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the less nice features of Make is that it's quite complex, and it doesn't play that nicely with Windows. There is a lot extra that you can do with it, and with the complexity of your makefile, that goes beyond what we saw in the simple example above‚Äîthough, as noted, the [Turing's tutorial](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/make/make-examples.html) is a great place to start.\n",

    "So, you've created your project's code in a modular way, you've used a sensible structure for your files, *and* you've set everything up as a reproducible analytical pipeline (or RAP). But now imagine a scenario where your computer breaks, and you need buy a new one, load it up, and try to run the code, or perhaps your colleague or co-author wants to run the code. What do you do!?\n",
    "\n",
    "For code to be truly reproducible, you, your colleagues, and your co-authors (and possibly reviewers too) need to be able to do reproduce the exact set of packages and version of programming languages that you used to generate your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we hit upon another important principle of reproducible analysis: *you should use a clean, dedicated Python environment and set of packages for each project that you do.* This means that only packages that are necessary for your RAP need be installed and included, and makes it easier to isolate what others will need to re-run that project's scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Python makes this possible because it allows *virtual environments*: that is, you do not need to just have one, monolithic installation of Python on your computer but, instead, have many apparently different versions, each one dedicated to a particular project. And you can do it without the pain of actually installing many different versions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, for many years, this was quite complicated, so much so that it inspired the XKCD comic below! But although there are still unfortunately many tools for reproducing Python environments, the tools and situation are much better than they once were.\n",

    "![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)\n",

    "It may be easier to illustrate creating Python environments with an example. Let's say you're using Python 3.8, statsmodels, and pandas for one project, project A. And, for project B, you're using Python 3.8 with numpy and scikit-learn. Best practice would be to have two separate virtual Python environments: environment A, with everything needed for project A, and environment B, with everything needed for project B. This way, when you \"hand over\" project A to a colleague, what they need is clear‚Äîand even specified as *part* of the documents contained within the project. Better still, you can specify the version of Python too.\n",

    "There are two ways one could create reproducible Python environments that we're going to look at in this section: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/). *uv is recommended for full reproducibility but you may find Miniconda to be more convenient for some packages involving compiled code*. Miniconda can get you most, but not all, of the way to reproducible Python environments and are an excellent back-up option if you don't want to use uv.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the details though, a word of warning: even if you install the same packages and the same version of a programming language, you may still get differences on different operating systems (or other differences in computers, like hardware). uv is at the absolute forefront of making environments work across operating systems but it's a hard problem. This will be explored later on in this chapter.\n",

    "### Reproducible Environments with uv\n",
    "\n",
    "[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a relatively new but really quite amazing command line tool that performs several important tasks:\n",
    "- automatically creates virtual environments on a per project basis (these environments live in a `.venv` file in the root folder of your project)\n",
    "- manages and installs Python packages and their dependencies, and logs their versions automatically\n",
    "- manages and installs Python itself\n",
    "- can create cross-platform logs of all packages and their dependencies called a lock file\n",

    "- (advanced) uploads Python packages to PyPI where they can be installed by others\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To add and install packages, the command is `uv add package-name`. As you add packages, you will see that `pyproject.toml` automatically becomes populated with what you installed. Here's an excerpt of a typical `pyproject.toml` file designed for reproducibility:\n",

    "A second file, `uv.lock`, is also created. This \"locks\" down the dependencies of your packages. It's also human-readable, just not very compelling. Visual Studio Code will happily open both types of file. In that file is a list of every package directly used, the version that's installed, and the dependencies of that package and what versions of *those* is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you send someone else the project, they will get the automatically generated `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files. Then, all they need is to navigate to the project folder in the command line, and enter `uv sync --frozen`. This will install all of the (same versions of) packages needed to run the code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, if you want to use the virtual environment to run scripts or tools installed using `uv add`, you will need to use `uv run command-name` rather than the usual `command-name`. For example, if you have a script `analysis.py`, you would call it with `uv run Python analysis.py`.\n",

Second, the \"channels\" are where packages can be picked up from. \"conda-forge\" is a community-led effort that holds a superset of other packages and, by including it, you're saying you're happy for packages to come via this route too. Then the \"dependencies\" section lists the actual dependencies. These are what you'd get alternatively by running `conda install pandas`, etc., on the command line (assuming you had already installed Miniconda and put it on your computer's PATH).\n",

So we also include `pip` as a dependency and then go on to say \"install some dependencies via `pip`\", that is install these as if a person had typed `pip install packagename` on the command line.

There are some nuances to that story, but the important point is it's just too painful and complicated to create perfectly reproducible environments using conda & pip together right now (and, really, you want a solution that can cover both given conda doesn't cover all Python packages).\n",

    "1. Install the VS Code remote: containers extension ([more info on that here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview))\n",
    "2. Click on the 'remote explorer' icon on the left-hand panel in Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "3. Select \"containers\" from the drop-down menu (not \"SSH Targets\" or \"Github Codespaces\")\n",
    "4. Right-click on the image you'd like to connect to (perhaps \"pythonbasic\" from the example above), and hit \"Attach to container\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a new Visual Studio Code window pop up with a message, \"Starting Dev Container\". This may take a while on the first run, as VS Code installs what it needs to connect remotely. But, once it's done, you'll find that you can navigate your Docker container, open a terminal in it, and do a lot of what you would normally but *within* the Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, you can do much the same trick with other VS Code remote options‚ÄîSSH or GitHub Codespaces, but don't worry if you don't know what these are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that you could do your entire development in a Docker container from the start if you wished to truly ensure that everything was isolated and repeatable. For extremely advanced users creating software tools, this [article explains how you can create a \"development container\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) for software development. For everyone else, a variation on what we've seen would be fine.\n",

    "## Saving Your Analysis For Prosperity\n",
    "\n",
    "True reproducible analysis should be findable and accessible, as well as interoperable and re-usable (these are the FAIR principles for data, but they pretty much work for analysis too). So how can you make what you've done findable and accessible to others?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we try to answer that, it's worth noting that, for an analysis that's to be preserved in perpetuity, you really want to freeze it in time. So although github and gitlab are great to sharing dynamically changing content, they're not as good for long-term preservation. Or, at the very least, you need clear version labels that are used to say what version of the code was used to produce a particular analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some fantastic options out there for preserving your code base (and therefore your reproducible project) while also making it findable and accessible. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) accepts both code and data (up to 50GB at the time of writing), and gives each repo a DOI, or Digital Object Identifier, a \"perma-link\" that will always take users to that repository regardless of other website changes. Importantly, different versions are supported and clearly labelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also now integrate a github repo and Zenodo; instructions are available in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-cite.html#cm-citable-cite-software).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also integrate Zenodo, a github repo, and Binder too: so that people coming to your analysis on Zenodo can, with a single click, create a fully interactive version of your analysis on Binder! See this [blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/binder-with-zenodo-af68ed6648a6) for details, and you may want to read the section above on repo2docker too.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reproducible analysis is a bit more tricky than you thought, eh? But, as noted at the start, you can derive a lot the value by doing only some of the steps. Although it's also worth thinking about reproducible analysis *right from the start of a project* so that it's not really painful to lever it back in at the end. In research especially, because you're exploring as you go, this can be hard work and you may have to \"refactor\" your code multiple times. Favouring simplicity over complexity can make it all go a lot more smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've looked at numerous tools throughout this chapter, especially for reproducibility for the steps at the start from automatic execution of your RAP onwards. It's worth suggesting a default set of tools which this book recommends as:\n",

    "**Recipe 1 for complete reproducible analytical pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. modular code in scripts\n",
    "2. Make for automatic execution of scripts and other tools according to a directed acyclic graph\n",
    "3. uv for capturing the versions of Python, packages, and the dependencies of packages\n",
    "4. manually creating a dedicated Dockerfile to reproduce an operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these tools are not very friendly to beginners, and sometimes uv can be less convenient for installing package dependencies that are not Python packages than `conda` (especially on Windows), so an alternative that goes a long way toward reproducibility is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recipe 2 for reproducible analytical pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. modular code in scripts\n",
    "2. A \"main.py\" script for automatic execution of scripts and other tools according to a directed acyclic graph (Python scripts can execute terminal commands too)\n",
    "3. A manually written `environment.yml` file for specifying the names (but not versions) of packages and the version of Python (for an example, see [here](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/blob/b4ad9ad978bcc2b0718155b42296088c8d90c548/codeforecon.yml))\n",
    "4. creating a dedicated Dockerfile to reproduce an operating system, either manually or using repo2docker\n",
