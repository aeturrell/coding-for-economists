    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will tell you about reproducible analysis and what are sometimes called \"reproducible analytical pipelines\", also known as RAPs. This chapter has benefitted from the \"[Quality Assurance of Code for Analysis and Research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance)\" book produced by the Best Practice and Impact division of the Office for National Statistics and \"The Turing Way\", a [guide to reproducibility](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app) produced by the Alan Turing Institute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people in a lot of different contexts. Here, we're going to think about the reproducibility of analysis performed by code. That excludes external validity and although it might include robust coding practices, it doesn't include robustness checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does include Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs), which are automated analytical processes. At their best, RAPs use elements of software engineering best practice to ensure that analysis is reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different levels and aspects of reproducibile analysis with code, which we will step through in the rest of this chapter, but they form a hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- modular code\n",
    "- sensible, isolated project structure\n",
    "- an unmodified version of the raw data is retained; outputs can be regenerated\n",
    "- operations should form a reproducible analytical pipeline\n",
    "- the reproducible analytical pipeline can be automatically executed\n",
    "- code language is reproducible (eg `Python=3.8.12` in pyproject.toml file)\n",
    "- code language packages are reproducible (eg `pandas=1.3.3` in pyproject.toml file)\n",
    "- code language packages' dependencies are reproducible (eg pandas depends on `numpy=1.21` as specified in poetry.lock file)\n",
    "- operating system is reproducible (as specified in a Docker file)\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the value to be had in reproducible code can be achieved by just the first five. Nailing all but the last one is a high standard and probably the right spot in the trade-off for most projects. Doing all of these is the rarely achieved gold standard for reproducibility (but could be overkill in many cases)."

    "\n",
    "The first principle to guide you should be that **each project lives in its own folder**. Everything for that project will appear somewhere under the top level directory. Do not mix projects in the same folder directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical project structure might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "📁 project\n",
    "|-- README.md\n",
    "|-- requirements.txt\n",
    "|-- data/\n",
    "|   -- raw_data.csv\n",
    "|-- src/\n",

    "|   -- floats/\n",
    "|       -- table.tex\n",
    "|       -- time_series_plot.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick tour through this example project's structure, all of which sits in the \"project\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have the README.md, a file full of instructions in a simple text format called *markdown* (=\".md\"). Markdown is kind of like a code language for text and is commonly used to write information in coding projects. It can be \"rendered\" (that is, can be displayed not as code but in a form that is intended to be read) by Visual Studio Code using the markdown all in one extension (see the {ref}`code-where` chapter for more on markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next file, \"requirements.txt\", is one we'll be seeing much more of later in this chapter. For now, all you need to do know is that it is a list of all of the Python packages needed to run the project. Sometimes it might be called \"environment.yml\" instead, or sometimes \"pyproject.toml\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have the data, which is the data as you received it, no matter how poor the format (wishful thinking in this example that it might be a clean csv file and not 400 Excel files!). A really important principle here is that **you should not alter raw data** as it comes to you, but instead treat it as read-only. This is so that you can always trace a path from the raw data you began with to the finished product. Incoming data can and does change surprisingly often so if someone else were to do the \"same\" analysis as you and find a different answer, you want to be able to rule out starting with different input datasets as the cause. Or you may find that your data cleaning script needs adjusting, and you need to repeat all of the operations in your project. Or other good reasons. Always keep a copy of the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next folder is \"src\", which is short for \"source code\", and it's where your code scripts (.py files) or possibly Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) live. These are nicely separate into the functions they perform: cleaning the data, performing the analysis, and summarising the analysis into figures and tables (also known as floats). The other script, \"utilities.py\", might be imported as module that all of the other scripts can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from running the first two scripts are in the \"results\" folder. First we have a file that saves the results from the intermediate step of the cleaning the data (courtesy of running \"data_cleaning.py\"), then we have the results from \"analysis.py\", the derived data. Derived data might be, for example, the final tabular dataset that you use for a regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is outputs, which is split into \"latex\" and \"floats\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Latex is a typesetting language that is used for writing reports, slides, journal articles, and more. Importantly for coding and replicability, it can be automated (in a way that, say, Word can't be). Another option here would be markdown, which can also be exported to a wide variety of output formats. The text in a Latex report has to be written, we can't automate that (yet), but the figures and tables that are generated by the \"generate_plots_and_tables.py\" script can be automatically inserted. The same goes for slides written in a variant of Latex called Beamer. You can find more information on the process of automating reports and outputs in the chapter on {ref}`wrkflow-automating-outputs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats means, here at least, tables and figures. These also live in the outputs directory, and are put there by the \"generate_plots_and_tables.py\" script.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the structure. There is another important principle here, which follows on from the first: **you should be able to dispose of the results, figures, and tables (ie delete them), without worrying**. If you are working on a project and deleting any outputs that are generated by code scripts would scupper everything, then your project is not reproducible. (This is another reason why you should always keep an \"untouched\" version of the raw data.) If it's feasible to do so time-wise, it is good practice to delete and regenerate your outputs regularly to test that your project is indeed reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course, many variations on this example project structure. You can find \"cookiecutter\" templates out there that will help you structure your own project (some involve answering some questions about what you need, and what you'd like to call project, and so on), or just get inspiration. Some good templates to check out that can help you structure your project are the UK Government data science, [govcookiecutter](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govcookiecutter) and this comprehensive Python data science project template known as [cookiecutter-data-science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). For advanced users looking to build Python packages that others can install, the [hypermodern Python cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter-hypermodern-python.readthedocs.io/en/2021.7.15/) is packed full of amazing features and comes highly recommended."

    "## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how functions and modules can aid the reproducibility of logic. We've seen the kind of folder and file structure that can aid reproducibility of projects too. But the *order* of operations matters as well! Pipelines organise your analysis in a series of steps that, when executed, perform the same series of operations in the same order. If you arrange your code in a reproducible analytical pipelines, you will know that you can send your code to someone else and, when they run it, the same steps will be executed in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll look at the concept in general as well as some tools that can aid you in creating reproducible analytical pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first principle of RAPs may be a surprise: you shouldn't use the interactive console interactively (eg by jamming, re-running lines, etc, as you go). A RAP should be able to go from start to finish with zero human interaction during execution, and produce consistent results at the end. This is different to when you're still developing a project, and the interactive console is super useful because you're trying things out. But RAP is for prosperity and needs to work without your intervention!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directed Acyclic Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Directed acyclic graphs pop up in lots of contexts. Here, in a RAP context, we're talking about them because the execution order of your code and scripts should form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The word \"graph\" here can be confusing: it's referring to the formal notion of a graph from the branch of mathematics called graph theory, which is the study of pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) that are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A DAG is a directed graph with no directed cycles (closed loops). It consists of vertices and edges with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following the directions will never form a closed loop. To summarise: \"directed\" means that edges between nodes have a direction and you can only traverse the graph in that direction (often shown by arrows in diagrams) and \"acyclic\": means there are no cycles so that, for example, a node A can’t depend on a node B when B depends on A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is that the set of operations that are performed when following a DAG proceeds like water flowing through a series of rapids: one step after another, with no looping back.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all a bit abstract and so it's a lot easier to just take a look at a visualisation of one. We'll use the example from the previous section boiled down to only the code scripts (.py files)."

    "Make is a command line tool (to learn more about what the command line is, check out {ref}`wrkflow-command-line`) that helps with automating the execution of a series of processes—exactly what we need in a RAP. Make does its magic via a command line script. Honestly, it's pretty fussy and complicated, which perhaps explains why it's not more popular, but it's well worth considering as one option for gold-plated reproducible analytical pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth saying up front that Make has little time for pipelines that produce more than one output per input dataset + script combination. This can be puzzling initially, but it's actually probably good practice to have one output per unique combination of inputs. The place where it makes less sense, perhaps, is if you have one script that produces all of your figures and tables.\n",

    "Make is not a Python library, so you'll need to download and install it separately. The installation instructions are different on different operating systems: you can find information on how to install Make [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). On Mac, if you use homebrew, the command to install it is `brew install make`. Similar commands exist for Linux. In Windows, you can use the [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager and then `choco install make` or work in the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n",

    "\n",
    "First up, phony tells Make that \"all\" and \"clean\" are not the names of outputs from the project, but commands. \"all\" is defined by `all: output/report.pdf` and is the first target—which means that when `Make` is run without any other information, it will be called. You can see further down the page what \"all\" does: it uses the .tex file and two figures to run `pdflatex` on `report.tex`, thus compiling the latex to a pdf. (It also does some sensible moving things around in the file system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"all\" depends on the figures being there. So, if they aren't, it will run the previous two commands listed in the makefile to create them: `output/figure_1.png` and `output/figure_2.png`. These rely on the input csv data and generate_histogram.py script being present and then run the scripts (remember, telling the command line `python script.py` runs the `script.py` from top to bottom). `-i` is a flag that precedes the name of an input, but rather than type out the name of the csv again, a shorthand has been used: `$<`, which just means \"look at the first thing in the command\". `-o` is the flag that precedes the name of an output but again a shorthand is used; `$@` means use the name of the target (here `output/figure_1.png` or `output/figure_2.png`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we mentioned earlier that it's good practice to delete your ouputs and check that your RAP can re-execute and produce everything again. \"clean\" is the command that does this (via `make clean`). `rm` is command-line speak for remove, and `*` is a wildcard character that can mean anything so here it deletes `figure_1.png` and `figure_2.png` if they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the nice features of Make is that it can auto-generate the DAG that is defined in the Makefile. Here's the makefile for this example rendered as a DAG by the programme [makefile2DAG](https://github.com/lindenb/makefile2graph), which uses another tool, graphviz.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the less nice features of Make is that it's quite complex, and it doesn't play that nicely with Windows. There is a lot extra that you can do with it, and with the complexity of your makefile, that goes beyond what we saw in the simple example above—though, as noted, the [Turing's tutorial](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/make/make-examples.html) is a great place to start."

    "[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a popular tool that shares a lot of similarities with Make but, instead of a Makefile, you write instructions in an arguably simpler format, yaml. Despite being very much geared around the Python ecosystem (and especially biological and genetic applications), it—like Make—can be used to automate any command that you would issue in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example (from biology) of a simple **snakemake** file, which would be saved as \"Snakefile\":\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, example `snakemake mapped_reads/{A,B}.bam` on the command line in the same directory as the Snakefile would execute the `bwa_map` command in order to create both \"mapped_reads/A.bam\" and \"mapped_reads/B.bam\". The curly brackets make use of the fact that the command line addresses everything in curly brackets, and so address both the \"A\" and \"B\" cases.\n",

Well, happily, there are tools that aim to make defining a reproducible analytical pipeline *far* easier. [Ploomber](https://ploomber.readthedocs.io/) is one such tool that we'll look at in this section. It supports Python and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you wish to use Ploomber to create plots of your DAG, you will need to install Ploomber's optional dependencies, including [pygraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/) and non-Python library [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org). To install the latter on Mac, you can use homebrew to run `brew install graphviz` on the command line, while `sudo apt install graphviz` works on some flavours of Linux. You can download Windows installers and find more information about this [here](https://www.graphviz.org/download/).\n",

One of its nice features is that it can tell when a pipeline was last executed and—if you make a change—it will only re-run scripts that are *downstream* of that change. It infers your DAG by having you add tags to your Python or R scripts that say what script they are upstream or downstream of (and any outputs they might create), and by having you write a yaml file with more info on the execution products. The three key commands are:\n",
    "- `ploomber plot`, which shows the DAG that you've defined;\n",

    "## Reproducible Python Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you've created your project's code in a modular way, you've used a sensible structure for your files, *and* you've set everything up as a reproducible analytical pipeline (or RAP). But now imagine a scenario where your computer breaks, and you need buy a new one, load it up, and try to run the code, or perhaps your colleague or co-author wants to run the code. What do you do!?\n",
    "\n",
    "For code to be truly reproducible, you, your colleagues, and your co-authors (and possibly reviewers too) need to be able to do reproduce the exact set of packages and version of programming languages that you used to generate your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we hit upon another important principle of reproducible analysis: *you should use a clean, dedicated Python environment and set of packages for each project that you do.* This means that only packages that are necessary for your RAP need be installed and included, and makes it easier to isolate what others will need to re-run that project's scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Python makes this possible because it allows *virtual environments*: that is, you do not need to just have one, monolithic installation of Python on your computer but, instead, have many apparently different versions, each one dedicated to a particular project. And you can do it without the pain of actually installing many different versions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be easier to illustrate with an example. Let's say you're using Python 3.8, statsmodels, and pandas for one project, project A. And, for project B, you're using Python 3.8 with numpy and scikit-learn. Best practice would be to have two separate virtual Python environments: environment A, with everything needed for project A, and environment B, with everything needed for project B. This way, when you \"hand over\" project A to a colleague, what they need is clear—and even specified as *part* of the documents contained within the project. Better still, you can specify the version of Python too.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways one could create reproducible Python environments that we're going to look at in this section: poetry and Anaconda. *You are strongly recommended to use Poetry for full reproducibility*. Anaconda environments can get you most, but not all, of the way there and are an excellent back-up option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the details though, a word of warning: even if you install the same packages and the same version of a programming language, you may still get differences on different operating systems (or other differences in computers, like hardware). This will be explored later on in this chapter.\n",

    "### Reproducible Environments with Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a relatively new but really quite amazing command line tool that performs several important tasks:\n",
    "- automatically creates virtual environments on a per project basis\n",
    "- manages Python package dependencies, and logs them automatically\n",
    "- manages Python package versions, and logs them automatically\n",
    "- installs all needed dependencies and packages from previously auto-generated (by Poetry) lists of versions\n",
    "- (advanced) builds Python packages\n",
    "- (advanced) uploads Python packages to PyPI where they can be installed (ie make your project pip installable)\n",
    "\n",
    "A pre-requisite for poetry is an installation of the version of Python that you plan to use for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use poetry, install it, and navigate to your project folder within the command line. Then run `poetry init`. This will create a (human-readable) `pyproject.toml` file that lists the packages needed for your project. It will also create a virtual Python environment just for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add and install packages, the command is `poetry add package-name`. As you add packages, you will see that `pyproject.toml` automatically becomes populated with what you installed. Here's an excerpt of the `pyproject.toml` file from the Python [skimpy](https://github.com/aeturrell/skimpy) package:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A second file, `poetry.lock`, is also created. This \"locks\" down the dependencies of your packages. It's also human-readable, just not very compelling. Visual Studio Code will happily open both types of file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where poetry really shines is when you send someone else the project. They receive all the files for your project, including the automatically generated `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files. Then, all they need is to have the right version of Python installed, navigate to the project folder in the command line, and enter `poetry install`. This will install all of the packages needed to run the code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, if you want to use the virtual environment to run scripts or tools installed using `poetry add`, you will need to use `poetry run command-name` rather than the usual `command-name`. For example, if you have a script `analysis.py`, you would call it with `poetry run Python analysis.py`. You can also open a command line within the virtual environment using `poetry shell`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although poetry is geared towards developers who are creating Python packages, it's fast becoming the best go-to option for reproducible Python environments. When using poetry for reproducible research, you're likely to want to pin to specific versions of all packages."

Second, the \"channels\" are where packages can be picked up from. The \"defaults\" channel provides the usual conda ones. \"conda-forge\" is a community-led effort that holds a superset of other packages and, by including it, you're saying you're happy for packages to come via this route too. Then the \"dependencies\" section lists the actual dependencies. These are what you'd get alternatively by running `conda install pandas=1.3.3`, etc., on the command line (assuming you had already installed Anaconda and put it on your computer's PATH).\n",

So we also include `pip` as a dependency and then go on to say \"install some dependencies via `pip`\", that is install these as if a person had typed `pip install packagename=version` on the command line. Remember, pip installing a package pulls it down from PyPI, which is the biggest and most widely used Python package store.\n",

    "Now, developing on the command line like this is no fun, clearly. You want access to all of the power of an IDE. Fortunately, Visual Studio Code is designed to be able to connect from your desktop computer to the *inside* of your Docker container and provide a development experience as if you were running Visual Studio Code as normal.\n",

    "You can find instructions and a LOT more detail [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/attach-container#_attach-to-a-docker-container), but the short version is that you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the VS Code remote: containers extension ([more info on that here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview))\n",
    "2. Click on the 'remote explorer' icon on the left-hand panel in Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "3. Select \"containers\" from the drop-down menu (not \"SSH Targets\" or \"Github Codespaces\")\n",
    "4. Right-click on the image you'd like to connect to (perhaps \"pythonbasic\" from the example above), and hit \"Attach to container\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a new Visual Studio Code window pop up with a message, \"Starting Dev Container\". This may take a while on the first run, as VS Code installs what it needs to connect remotely. But, once it's done, you'll find that you can navigate your Docker container, open a terminal in it, and do a lot of what you would normally but *within* the Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, you can do much the same trick with other VS Code remote options—SSH or Github Codespaces, but don't worry if you don't know what these are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that you could do your entire development in a Docker container from the start if you wished to truly ensure that everything was isolated and repeatable. For extremely advanced users creating software tools, this [article explains how you can create a \"development container\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) for software development. For everyone else, a variation on what we've seen would be fine.\n",
