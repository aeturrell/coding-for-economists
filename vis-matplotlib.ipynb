    "There are actually two ways to use **matplotlib**: the 'pyplot API' and the 'object-oriented API'. The pyplot API (application programming interface) gives an experience that's much closer to the paid programming language Matlab and can be useful to make a quick chart. This is no accident; **matplotlib** originally grew out of a desire to provide plotting functionality that was similar to what was found in Matlab. However, it has subsequently taken on its own style and API, and these developments are now much more powerful and convenient for plotting in Python.\n",

You should think of the figure object, `fig`, as the canvas on which you can put any number of charts. Each ax (short for 'axis') object is one chart within a figure. Of course, most of the time you're likely only to have one axis per figure, but in the cases when you don't it's a really useful setup. The plotting of elements such as lines, points, bars, and so, are controlled by the `ax` objects while the overall settings are controlled by `fig`.\n",

    "- Figure, or 'fig': the figure keeps track of all the child Axes that are on it and a smattering of 'special' artists (titles, figure legends, etc). A figure can contain any number of Axes, but will typically have at least one.\n",
    "- Axes, or 'ax': this is the plot, the region of the image that traces out the data. A given Figure can contain many Axes, but a given Axes object can only be in one Figure. The Axes contains two (or three in the case of 3D) Axis objects (Axes and Axis are different things!) that record the data limits (you can override these via the `axes.Axes.set_xlim()` and `axes.Axes.set_ylim()` methods). Each Axes object has a title (set via `set_title()`), an x-label (set via `set_xlabel()`), and a y-label set via `set_ylabel()`). When you add, say, a line chart to an Axes object it appears as a Line2D object associated that that axis and it is created by calling a method on an Axes object.\n",
    "- Axis: these are the number-line objects that control the limits of what the viewer can see. They also provide the means to access the ticks (the marks on the axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks). The location of the ticks is determined by a Locator object and the ticklabel strings are formatted by a Formatter. The combination of Locator and Formatter gives very fine control over the tick locations and labels.\n",

The object-oriented structure of **matplotlib** plots can be confusing at first, but, as we'll see, it pretty much fades into the background when you're making plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **matplotlib** is super-customisable, sometimes achieving what you want directly can be a bit verbose. Let's say we want to now differentiate these points with colour according to which state they belong to and add a legend that says which states have which colour. The easiest way to do this is by creating a for loop."

    "- [**proplot**](https://proplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) aims to be \"A lightweight matplotlib wrapper for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics\", though the style is more similar to how people might make plots in the hard sciences rather than the social sciences. The point of this library is to take some of the verbosity out of **matplotlib**.\n",
    "- if you're using very big data in machine learning models, it might be worth looking at Facebook's [**hiplot**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hiplot)\n",
    "- [Seaborn image](https://seaborn-image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) does for image data what **seaborn** does for numerical and categorical data\n",
    "- [Lit](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/) provides an open-source platform for visualization and understanding of NLP models (very impressive)\n",
    "- [Wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) does exactly what you'd expect (but use word clouds *very* sparingly!)\n",
    "- [VisPy](http://vispy.org) for very large datasets plotted with WebGL and GPU acceleration.\n",
    "- [PyQtGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/), a pure-Python graphics library for PyQt5/PySide2 and intended for use in (heavy) mathematics / scientific / engineering applications (not very user friendly).\n",
    "- [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html#) offers interactive web plotting in Python.\n",
    "- [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/), a library dsigned to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple with very concise commands (builds on bokeh and matplotlib).\n",
    "- [YellowBrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/) for visualisations of machine learning models and metrics.\n",
    "- [facets](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/) for quickly visualising machine learning features (aka regressors). Also useful for exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "- [chartify](https://github.com/spotify/chartify), Spotify's quick plotting library for data scientists.\n",
    "- [scikit-plot](https://github.com/reiinakano/scikit-plot) offers plotting tools designed around Python's wildy popular scikit-learn machine learning library.\n",
    "- [themepy](https://github.com/petermckeeverPerform/themepy) is an open source theme selector / creator and aesthetic manager for Matplotlib.\n",
    "- [scienceplots](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots) provides scientific plotting styles--some associated with specific journals--for Matplotlib.\n",
    "- [colour](https://www.colour-science.org/) provides professional level colour tools for Python.\n",
    "- [palettable](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/) has extra colour palettes that work well with Matplotlib.\n",
    "- [colorcet](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/) is a collection of perceptually uniform colourmaps.\n",
    "- [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno) for visualization of missing data.\n",
    "- [bashplotlib](https://github.com/glamp/bashplotlib), for when you want to make visualisations directly from the command line (I don't imagine this will be very often, but always good to know the option is there!)\n",
