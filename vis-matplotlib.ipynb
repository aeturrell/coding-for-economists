    "Here you'll see how to make just about any plot you can possibly imagine using the ferociously powerful *imperative* graphing package, **matplotlib**. Here, it will be about explaining the basics. If you read on to the chapter on {ref}`vis-narrative`, you'll see just how flexible it is and how it can produce commercial-quality graphics. Additionally, **matplotlib** is the foundation stone of quite a few other data visualisation libraries (including **plotnine** and **seaborn**) which shows how much it can do. It was famously used to create the first ever image of a black hole by {cite:t}`akiyama2019first`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**matplotlib** {cite:ps}`hunter2007matplotlib` has its origin in an attempt to replicate the plotting functionality of the paid programming language Matlab but has since outgrown these roots. Because **matplotlib** has been around a long time and there are different ways to use it, much of the material online about how to use **matplotlib** uses the old, Matlab-inspired approach---which is not what this book recommends; instead, we strongly recommend the modern object oriented API. If you see a plot feature that begins `plt.scatter` or similar, then it's using the legacy API rather than the now recommended \"object oriented API\" which is focused around axes, eg `ax.scatter` and similar. You want to follow examples that use the object-oriented approach.\n",

You should think of the figure object, `fig`, as the canvas on which you can put any number of charts. Each ax (short for 'axis') object is one chart within a figure. Of course, most of the time you're likely only to have one axis per figure, but in the cases when you don't it's a really useful setup. The plotting of elements such as lines, points, bars, and so, are controlled by the `ax` objects while the overall settings are controlled by `fig`.\n",

Each Axes object has a title (set via `set_title()`), an x-label (set via `set_xlabel()`), and a y-label set via `set_ylabel()`).
