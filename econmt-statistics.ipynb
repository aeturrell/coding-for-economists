    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn about how to do statistics with code. We already saw some statistics in the chapter on probability and random processes: here we'll focus on computing basic statistics and using statistical tests. We'll make use of the excellent [*pingouin*](https://pingouin-stats.org/index.html) statistics package and its documentation for many of the examples and methods in this chapter {cite:ps}`vallat2018pingouin`. This chapter also draws on Open Intro Statistics {cite:ps}`diez2012openintro`.\n",

    "### Notation and basic definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Greek letters, like $\\beta$, are the truth and represent parameters. Modified Greek letters are an estimate of the truth, for example $\\hat{\\beta}$. Sometimes Greek letters will stand in for vectors of parameters. Most of the time, upper case Latin characters such as $X$ will represent random variables (which could have more than one dimension). Lower case letters from the Latin alphabet denote realised data, for instance $x$ (which again could be multi-dimensional).  Modified Latin alphabet letters denote computations performed on data, for instance $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i} x_i$ where $n$ is number of samples. Parameters are given following a vertical bar, for example if $f(x|\\mu, \\sigma)$ is a probability density function, the vertical line indicates that its parameters are $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. The set of distributions with densities $f_\\theta(x)$, $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ is called a parametric family, eg there is a family of different distributions that are parametrised by $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statistic** $T(x)$ is a function of the data $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **estimator** of a parameter $\\theta$ is a function $T=T(x)$ which is used to estimate $\\theta$ based on observations of data. $T$ is an unbiased estimator if $\\mathbb{E}(T) = \\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X$ has PDF $f(x|\\theta)$ then, given the observed value $x$ of $X$, the **likelihood** of $\\theta$ is defined by $\\text{lik}(\\theta) = f(x | \\theta)$. For independent and identically distributed observed values, then $\\text{lik}(\\theta) = f(x_1, \\dots, x_n| \\theta) = \\Pi_{i=1}^n f(x_i | \\theta)$. The $\\hat{\\theta}$ such that this function attains its maximum value is the **maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)** of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an MLE $\\hat{\\theta}$ of $\\theta$, $\\hat{\\theta}$ is said to be **consistent** if $\\mathbb{P}(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta > \\epsilon) \\rightarrow 0$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimator *W* is **efficient** relative to another estimator $V$ if $\\text{Var}(W) < \\text{Var}(V)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\alpha$ be the 'significance level' of a test statistic $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\gamma(X)$ and $\\delta(X)$ be two statistics satisfying $\\gamma(X) < \\delta(X)$ for all $X$. If on observing $X = x$, the inference can be made that $\\gamma(x) \\leq \\theta \\leq \\delta(x)$. Then $[\\delta(x), \\gamma(x)]$ is an **interval estimate** and $[\\delta(X), \\gamma(X)]$ is an **interval estimator**. The random interval (random because the *endpoints* are random variables) $[\\delta(X), \\gamma(X)]$ is called a $100\\cdot\\alpha \\%$ **confidence interval** for $\\theta$. Of course, there is a true $\\theta$, so either it is in this interval or it is not. But if the confidence interval was constructed many times over using samples, $\\theta$ would be contained within it $100\\cdot\\alpha \\%$ of the times.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hypothesis test** is a conjecture about the distribution of one or more random variables, and a test of a hypothesis is a procedure for deciding whether or not to reject that conjecture. The **null hypothesis**, $H_0$, is only ever conservatively rejected and represents the default position. The **alternative hypothesis**, $H_1$, is the conclusion contrary to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A type I error occurs when $H_0$ is rejected when it is true, ie when a *true* null hypothesis is rejected. Mistakenly failing to reject a false null hypothesis is called a type II error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most simple situations, the upper bound on the probability of a type I error is called the size or **significance level** of the *test*. The **p-value** of a random variable $X$ is the smallest value of the significance level (denoted $\\alpha$) for which $H_0$ would be rejected on the basis of seeing $x$. The p-value is sometimes called the significance level of $X$. The probability that a test will reject the null is called the power of the test. The probability of a type II error is equal to 1 minus the power of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that there are two types of statistics out there: parametrised, eg by $\\theta$, and non-parametrised. The latter are often distribution free (ie don't involve a PDF) or don't require parameters to be specified.\n",

The standard deviation of the reduction in blood pressure of those receiving the old drug is 12 units. The null hypothesis is that the new drug is no more effective than the new drug. But it will only be worth switching production to the new drug if it reduces blood pressure by more than 3 units versus the old drug. In this case, the effect size of interest is 3 units.\n",

    "Let's assume for a moment that the true difference is 3 units and we want to perform a test with $\\alpha=0.05$. The problem is that, for small differences in the effect, the distribution of effects under the null and the distribution of effects under the alternative have a great deal of overlap. So the chances of making a Type II error - accepting the null hypothesis when it is actually false - is quite high. Let's say we'd ideally have at most a 20% chance of making a Type II error: what sample size do we need?\n",
