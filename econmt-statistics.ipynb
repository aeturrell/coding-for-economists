    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn about how to do statistics with code. We already saw some statistics in the chapter on probability and random processes: here we'll focus on computing basic statistics and using statistical tests. We'll make use of the excellent [*pingouin*](https://pingouin-stats.org/index.html) statistics package and its documentation for many of the examples and methods in this chapter {cite}`vallat2018pingouin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation and basic definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Greek letters, like $\\beta$, are the truth and represent parameters. Modified Greek letters are an estimate of the truth, for example $\\hat{\\beta}$. Sometimes Greek letters will stand in for vectors of parameters. Most of the time, upper case Latin characters such as $X$ will represent random variables (which could have more than one dimension). Lower case letters from the Latin alphabet denote realised data, for instance $x$ (which again could be multi-dimensional).  Modified Latin alphabet letters denote computations performed on data, for instance $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i} x_i$ where $n$ is number of samples. Parameters are given following a vertical bar, for example if $f(x|\\mu, \\sigma)$ is a probability density function, the vertical line indicates that its parameters are $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. The set of distributions with densities $f_\\theta(x)$, $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ is called a parametric family, eg there is a family of different distributions that are parametrised by $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statistic** $T(x)$ is a function of the data $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **estimator** of a parameter $\\theta$ is a function $T=T(x)$ which is used to estimate $\\theta$ based on observations of data. $T$ is an unbiased estimator if $\\mathbb{E}(T) = \\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X$ has PDF $f(x|\\theta)$ then, given the observed value $x$ of $X$, the **likelihood** of $\\theta$ is defined by $\\text{lik}(\\theta) = f(x | \\theta)$. For independent and identically distributed observed values, then $\\text{lik}(\\theta) = f(x_1, \\dots, x_n| \\theta) = \\Pi_{i=1}^n f(x_i | \\theta)$. The $\\hat{\\theta}$ such that this function attains its maximum value is the **maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)** of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an MLE $\\hat{\\theta}$ of $\\theta$, $\\hat{\\theta}$ is said to be **consistent** if $\\mathbb{P}(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta > \\epsilon) \\rightarrow 0$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\gamma(X)$ and $\\delta(X)$ be two statistics satisfying $\\gamma(X) < \\delta(X)$ for all $X$. If on observing $X = x$, the inference can be made that $\\gamma(x) \\leq \\theta \\leq \\delta(x)$. Then $[\\delta(x), \\gamma(x)]$ is an **interval estimate** and $[\\delta(X), \\gamma(X)]$ is an **interval estimator**. The random interval (random because the *endpoints* are random variables) $[\\delta(X), \\gamma(X)]$ is called a $100\\cdot\\alpha \\%$ **confidence interval** for $\\theta$. Of course, there is a true $\\theta$, so either it is in this interval or it is not. But if the confidence interval was constructed many times over using samples, then it would contain $\\theta$ $100\\cdot\\alpha \\%$ of the times.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hypothesis test** is a conjecture about the distribution of one or more random variables, and a test of a hypothesis is a procedure for deciding whether or not to reject that conjecture. The **null hypothesis** is $H_0$ is only ever conservatively rejected. If it *is* rejected, the **alternative hypothesis**, $H_1$, is accepted. If $H_0$ is rejected when it is true, it is a type I error (arguably more serioues given the test favours $H_0$); if $H_1$ is accepted when it is false, it is a type II error. In the most simple situations, the upper bound on the probability of a type I error is called the size or **significance level** of the *test*. The **p-value** of a random variable $X$ is the smallest value of the significance level (often denoted $\\alpha$) for which $H_0$ would be rejected on the basis of seeing $x$. The p-value is sometimes called the significance level of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that there are two types of statistics out there: parametrised, eg by $\\theta$, and non-parametrised. The latter are often distribution free (ie don't involve a PDF) or don't require parameters to be specified.\n",
