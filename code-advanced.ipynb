    "- A testing 'unit' should focus on a single bit of functionality;\n",

    "- If you know how, it's a good idea to use something like a 'Git hook' that runs tests before code is saved in a shared repository;\n",
    "- If you find a bug in your code, it's good practice to write a new test that targets it; and\n",

    "\n",
    "Type annotations were introduced in Python 3.5 (these notes are written in 3.8). If you've seen more low-level languages, typing will be familiar to you. Python uses 'duck typing' (\"if it walks and quacks like a duck, it is a duck\") which means that if a variable walks like an integer, and talks like an integer, then it gets treated as if it is an integer. Ditto for other variable types. Duck typing is useful if you just want to code quickly and aren't writing production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "But... there are times when you *do* know what variable types you're going to be dealing with ahead of time and you want to prevent the propagation of the wrong kinds of variable types. In these situations, you can clearly say what variable types are supposed to be. And, when used with some other packages, typing can make code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it doesn't have to be all or nothing on type checking, you can just add it in gradually or where you think it's most important.\n",

    "One can use object-oriented methods and inheritance to get different code objects to behave in different ways depending on the type of input. For example, a different behaviour might occur if you send a string into a function versus an integer. An alternative to the object-oriented approach is to use *multiple dispatch*. [**fastcore**](https://fastcore.fast.ai/) is a library that provides \"goodies to make your coding faster, easier, and more maintainable\" and has many neat features but amongst the 'goodies' is multiple dispatch, with the `typedispatch` decorator."

The different inputs get routed into the different versions of the `@typeddispatch` function.
