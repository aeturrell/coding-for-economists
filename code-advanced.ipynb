Coding languages tend to be more object-oriented or functional, with the object-oriented approach originating with Alan Turing's \"Turing Machines\" and the functional approach with Alonso Church's \"lambda calculus\". These two approaches are mathematically equivalent and, on a more practical note, high-level programming languages often mix both. As examples, Haskell is strongly a functional language, statistics language R leans toward being more functional, Python is slightly more object oriented, and powerhouse languages like Fortran and C are object-oriented. However, despite being less functional than some languages, Python does have lambda functions, for example:"

For example, if you had a dataframe with a column of string called 'strings' that you want to change to “Title Case” and replace one phrase with another, you could use lambda functions to do that (there are better ways of doing this but this is useful as a simple example):"
