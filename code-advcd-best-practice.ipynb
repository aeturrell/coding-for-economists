    "## Auto-magically improving your code\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we met the idea of *code style*: even for code that runs, *how* you write it matters for readability. (And it goes without saying that you don't want bugs in your code that stop it running at all.) It is possible to catch some errors, to flag style issues, and even to re-format code to comply with a code style automatically. In this section, we'll see how to use tools to perform these functions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linting\n",
    "\n",
    "Linters are tools that analyse code for programmatic and stylistic errors, assuming you have declared a style. A linting tool flags any potential errors and deviations from style before you even run it. When you run a linter, you get a report of what line the issue is on and why it has been raised. They are supposedly named after the lint trap in a clothes dryer because of the way they catch small errors that could have big effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular linters in Python is the blazingly-fast [**Ruff**](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) but you might also come across [**flake8**](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), [**pycodestyle**](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html), and [**pylint**](https://www.pylint.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of running a linter. VS Code has direct integration with a range of linters. To get going, use `⇧⌘P` (Mac) and then type 'Python Select Linter'. In the example below, we'll use **flake8** (and **pylance**, another VS Code extension). Let's pretend we have a script, `test.py`, containing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_defn = [1,5, 6,\n",
    "7]\n",
    "\n",
    "def this_is_a_func():\n",
    "   print('hello')\n",
    "\n",

    "To see the linting report, press <kbd>^</kbd> + <kbd>\\`</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> (otherwise) and navigate to the 'Problems' tab. We get a whole load of error messages about this script, here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ⓧ missing whitespace after ',' flake8(E231) 1, 15\n",
    "- ⓧ continuation line under-indented for visual indent flake8(E128) 2, 1\n",
    "- ⓧ expected 2 blank lines, found 1 flake8(E302) 4, 1\n",
    "- ⓧ indentation is not a multiple of 4 flake8(E111) 5, 4\n",
    "- ⓧ undefined name 'X' flake8(F821) 7, 7\n",
    "- ⓧ module level import not at top of file flake8(E402) 9, 1\n",
    "- ⓧ 'numpy as np' imported but unused flake8(F3401) 9, 1\n",
    "- ⚠ \"X\" is not defined Pylance(reportUndefinedVariable) 7, 7\n",
    "- ⚠ no newline at end of file flake8(W292) 78, 338\n",
    "\n",
    "each message is a warning or error that says what the problem is (for example, missing whitespace after ','), what library is reporting it (mostly **flake8** here), the name of the rule that has been broken (E231), and the line, row position (1, 15). Very helpfully, we get an undefined name message for variable `X`, this is especially handy because it would cause an error on execution otherwise. The same goes for the indentation message (indentation matters!). You can customise your [linting settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) in VS Code too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the automatic linting offered by an IDE is very convenient, it's not the only way to use linting tools. You can also run them from the command line. For example, for **flake8**, the command is `flake8 test.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "It's great to find out all the ways in which you are failing with respect to code style from a linter but wouldn't it be *even* better if you could fix those style issues automatically? The answer is clearly yes! This is where formatters come in; they can take valid code and forcibly apply a code style to them. This is really handy in practice for all kinds of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular code formatters in Python are probably: [**yapf**](https://github.com/google/yapf), 'yet another Python formatter', from Google; [**autopep8**](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8), which applies PEP8 to your code; [**black**](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the 'uncompromising formatter' that is very opinionated (\"any colour, as long as it's black\"); and [**Ruff**](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to use formatters, line-by-line (though **black** doesn't work in this mode) or on an entire script at once. VS Code offers an integration with formatters. To select a formatter in VS Code, bring up the settings using <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> (otherwise) and type 'python formatting provider' and you can choose from autopep8, black, and yapf. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose **autopep8** and then open a script you can format a *selection* of code by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> (otherwise). They can also (and only, in the case of **black**) be used from the command line. For instance, to use **black**, the command is `black test.py`, assuming you have it installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of a poorly styled script and see what happens when we select all lines and use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> to auto format with **autopep8**. The contents of `test.py` before formatting are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def very_important_function(y_val,debug = False, keyword_arg=0, another_arg  =2):\n",
    "    X = np.linspace(0,10,5)\n",
    "    return X+  y_val +keyword_arg\n",
    "very_important_function(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "list_defn = [1,\n",
    "2,\n",
    "3,\n",
    "5,\n",
    "6,\n",
    "7]\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and, after running the auto-formatting command,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def very_important_function(y_val, debug=False, keyword_arg=0, another_arg=2):\n",
    "    X = np.linspace(0, 10, 5)\n",
    "    return X + y_val + keyword_arg\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "very_important_function(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "list_defn = [1,\n",
    "             2,\n",
    "             3,\n",
    "             5,\n",
    "             6,\n",
    "             7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So what did the formatter do? Many things. It moved the import to the top, put two blank lines after the function definition, removed whitespace around keyword arguments, added a new line at the end, and fixed some of the indentation. The different formatters have different strengths and weaknesses; for example, **black** is not so good at putting imports in the right place but excels at splitting up troublesome wide lines. If you need a formatter that deals specifically with module imports, check out [**isort**](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) or [**Ruff**](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from taking the pressure off you to always be thinking about code style, formatters can be useful when working collaboratively too. For some open source packages, maintainers ask that new code or changed code be run through a particular formatter if it is to be incorporated into the main branch. This helps ensure the code style is consistent regardless of who is writing it. Running the code formatter can even be automated to happen every time someone *commits* some code to a shared code repository too, using something called a *pre-commit hook*.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: **Black** can run on Jupyter Notebooks too: just install it with `pip install \"black[jupyter]\"` instead of `pip install black`."

While we'll talk through the use of Visual Studio Code, which is free, directly supports Python, R, and other languages, and is especially rich, many of the features will be present in other IDEs too and the ideas are somewhat general. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin debugging using Visual Studio Code, get a script ready, for example `script.py`, that you'd like to debug. If your script has an error in, a debug run will automatically run into it and stop on the error; alternatively you can click to the left of the line number in your script to create a *breakpoint* that your code will stop at anyway when in debug mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin a debug session, click on the play button partially covered by a bug that's on the left hand ribbon of the VS Code window. It will bring up a menu. Click 'Run and debug' and select 'Python file'. The debugger will now start running the script you had open. When it reaches and error or a breakpoint it will stop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this useful? Once the code stops, you can hover over any variables and see what's 'inside' them, which is useful for working out what's going on. Remember, in the examples above, we only saw variables that we asked for. Using the debugger, we can hover over any variable we're interested in without having to decide ahead of time! We can also see other useful bits of info such as the *call stack* of functions that have been called, what local (within the current scope) and global (available everywhere) variables have been defined, and we can nominate variables to watch too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you now want to progress the code on from a breakpoint; you can do this too. You'll see that a menu has appeared with stop, restart, play, and other buttons on it. To skip over the next line of code, use the curved arrow over the dot. To dig in to the next line of code, for example if it's a function, use the arrow pointing toward a dot. To carry on running the code, use the play button.\n",

This excerpt from [Research Software Engineering with Python](https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/testing.html) explains why testing even research code is extremely useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why is testing research software important? A successful early career researcher in protein crystallography, Geoffrey Chang, had to retract five published papers—three from the journal Science—because his code had inadvertently flipped two columns of data (Miller 2006). More recently, a simple calculation mistake in a paper by Reinhart and Rogoff contributed to making the financial crash of 2008 even worse for millions of people (Borwein and Bailey 2013). Testing helps to catch errors like these.\n",

    "Back to testing: if you're writing a *package* of code for others to use, one that will change and grow over time, tests are essential. These are some general guidelines for good testing, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A testing 'unit' should focus on a single bit of functionality;\n",
    "- Each test unit must be fully independent (in practice, this means that `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods need to be defined to prep data or objects to the point where they can be used by the testing unit);\n",
    "- Tests should run fast if possible;\n",
    "- If you know how, it's a good idea to use something like a 'Git hook' that runs tests before code is saved in a shared repository;\n",
    "- If you find a bug in your code, it's good practice to write a new test that targets it; and\n",
    "- Although long, extremely descriptive names are not very helpful in regular code, they *should* be used for functions that test code because this is the name you will see when the test fails (and you want to know what it refers to).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to run tests is to add assertions to code. An assertion is a statement that something must be true at a certain point in a program. When an assertion evaluates to true, nothing happens; if it’s false, the programme stops and prints a user-defined error message. Here's an example of an assertion:"
