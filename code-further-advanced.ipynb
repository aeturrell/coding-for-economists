    "\n",
    "Type annotations were introduced in Python 3.5 (these notes are written in 3.8). If you've seen more low-level languages, typing will be familiar to you. Python uses 'duck typing' (\"if it walks and quacks like a duck, it is a duck\") which means that if a variable walks like an integer, and talks like an integer, then it gets treated as if it is an integer. Ditto for other variable types. Duck typing is useful if you just want to code quickly and aren't writing production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "But... there are times when you *do* know what variable types you're going to be dealing with ahead of time and you want to prevent the propagation of the wrong kinds of variable types. In these situations, you can clearly say what variable types are supposed to be. And, when used with some other packages, typing can make code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it doesn't have to be all or nothing on type checking, you can just add it in gradually or where you think it's most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's important to be really clear on one point, namely that *Python does **not** enforce type annotations*. But we can use *static type checking* to ensure all types are as they should be in *advance* of running. Before we do that, let's see how we add type annotations. \n",
