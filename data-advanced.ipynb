    "**pandas** isn't the only game in town, not by a long way—though it's by far the best supported and the most fully featured. **pandas** is a good default package to use for data in the vast majority of cases. But it's always good to have options—or, put another way, options have value! Other dataframe libraries may have a syntax that you prefer (**datatable**'s syntax is popular with some) or provide a speed-up in certain situations, for example when working with large datasets (**polars** promises to breeze through big data far faster than pandas can).\n",

And so various data validation methods have appeared that will fail loudly and proudly when your data are not as expected. Although most useful in a situation where data are being regularly updated, for example when producing a monthly index, these tools can also be useful if you want to be extra careful with your data in a research paper, if you are scaling up from a sample to a bigger dataset, or if you are updating an existing project.\n",

That's about *data type*, but these tools go beyond that and deal with values *within* a data type. So rather than just saying it's an integer, a data validation library might say that a column must be an integer between 0 and 100.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Synthetic* data take this one step further: they do capture some of the statistical properties of the underlying data and are generated from the underlying data. Again, they can be useful for trying out data before using the real thing—especially if the real data are highly confidential. A useful package for comparing real and synthetic data is [SynthGuage](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/synthgauge)."

    "## Data Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "Data orchestration is the automation of data-driven processes from end-to-end, including preparing data, making decisions based on that data, and taking actions based on those decisions. Think of a data pipeline in which you extract data (perhaps from files), transform it somehow, and load it into where you want to put it (downstream in your research process, or perhaps into an app). Sometimes these processes are called ETL, for extract, transform, and load. Some of their benefits include reproducibility, and being able to run tasks on a schedule—whether you are at your computer or not, and (if you're using them in the cloud), whether your computer is even on or not! They are dreamboats for automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of them visualise the tasks they have to carry out as a DAG, or Directed Acyclic Graph. This defines how different tasks depend on each other in order, with one task following from the previous one (or perhaps following from multiple previous tasks). When they carry out a DAG of tasks on an event or at a scheduled time, they create a log of the execution of the steps too—so if something goes wrong, you can always look back at it. However, they are a layer of abstraction between you and the data, and this does make them a more advanced tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going into further details of data orchestration is outside of the scope of this book, so we won't be seeing a practical example, but we think it's important enough to mention it and to point you to more resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some truly amazing tools out there to help you do this on a production scale. Broadly, there is a 1st generation of tools that are excellent but might have more trouble with tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- local development, testing, and storage abstractions\n",
    "- one-off and irregularly scheduled tasks\n",
    "- the movement of data between tasks\n",
    "- dynamic and parameterised workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "And there is a 2nd generation of tools that tries to solve some of these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 1st generation, by far the best known and most suited for production is Apache's (original AirBnB's) [**Airflow**](http://airflow.incubator.apache.org/). There's a less mature 1st generation tool from Spotify called [**Luigi**](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) too, but Airflow is widely used in the tech industry, and doesn't just schedule data processes in Python: it can run processes in pretty much whatever you like. Both of these tools try to solve the 'plumbing' associated with long-running batch processes on data: chaining tasks, automating them, dealing with failures, and scheduling. Both Luigi and Airflow have fancy interfaces to show you what's going on with your tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools in the 2nd generation include the easy-to-use [**Prefect**](https://www.prefect.io/), \"modern workflow orchestration for data and ML engineers\", and [**dagster**](https://dagster.io/), which bills itself as \"a data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL [extract, transform, and load]\". These have visualisation interfaces too, can run locally or on the cloud, and are more flexible about triggers for events.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a research project where you only need to execute your DAG once, and you're probably much more concerned about the costliness of each step than anything else, these tools are likely to be overkill or not quite what you need. But if you're automating an ETL process, they're perfect (prefect). The best place to get started is by looking at their webpages and googling around for tutorials."
