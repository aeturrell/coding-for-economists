    "\n",
    "When working with data, it's useful to have a way to validate that what you're getting is what you *think* you're getting. And so various data validation methods have appeared that will fail loudly and proudly when your data are not as expected. Although most useful in a situation where data are being regularly updated, for example when producing a monthly index, these tools can also be useful if you want to be extra careful with your data in a research paper, if you are scaling up from a sample to a bigger dataset, or if you are updating an existing project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the most minimal way to do some validation is to ensure that your dataframe has its columns cast as the right data types from the start, and this is good practice in general. That's about *data type*, but these tools go beyond that and deal with values *within* a data type. So rather than just saying it's an integer, a data validation library might say that a column must be an integer between 0 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal way that data validation libraries are used is that you specify some expectations you have of the dataset that will be flagged if and when they fail. Let's see some of the tools that are available that do this. As ever, this chapter has benefitted enormously from the documentation of the featured packages."

    "Data orchestration tools typically have a directed acyclic graph, a DAG, at the heart of how tasks are strung together. This defines how different tasks depend on each other in order, with one task following from the previous one (or perhaps following from multiple previous tasks). It's an automation dream.\n",

    "However, for a research project, it's hard to recommend these two tools as they're just a bit too powerful; Airflow in particular can do just about anything but has a steep learning curve. So, instead, to show the power of data orchestration we'll use a more lightweight but also very powerful library: [**dagster**](https://dagster.io/), which bills itself as 'a data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL [extract, transform, and load]'. Some of the key features are being able to implement components in various tools, such as Pandas and SQL, define pipelines as DAGs, and to test the same setup on your machine that you then deploy to cloud. Like the other tools, it has a nice visual interface to show what's happening. Necessarily, we'll only be seeing a very brief introduction to it here.\n",

    "**Dagster** works by using *function decorators* (the `@` symbol) to define the 'solids' that are the nodes in **dagster**'s DAG. The `@pipeline` defines the set of functions that are composed in the pipeline. Here's an example of defining a simple pipeline that produces the same phrase with different capitalisations:"

    "There are a lot of benefits to thinking about your data processing in terms of pipelines and DAGs. You can see the last time any particular node executed and, if node execution fails, you can see why, where, and how. The GUI has tons of extra functionality too; for instance, you can track what’s produced by your pipelines with the 'Asset Manager', so you can understand how your data was generated and trace issues when it doesn’t look how you expect. There's also optional typing of data types on input and output which helps you to catch bugs in data like you'd catch bugs in code (in the above, we declared all of the input types to be strings but didn't declare what the output types were so they appeared as 'any').\n",
