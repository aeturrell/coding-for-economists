    "Feature engineering, or feature extraction, is just data science talk for transformations. And, just as with the transformations we've seen, you need to take care whether you're running them as if in real time or not, and whether that matters.\n",

    "So, is there any real difference between time series econometrics transformations and those found in data science? There isn't in principle, but in practice the transformations used in data science are a superset of those typically used in econometrics, often because data scientists are trying to squeeze every last drop of predictability out of a time series and don't mind creating 100s of \"features\", aka regressors, to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest and most naive case, time series feature engineering just involve throwing the kitchen sink at features, ie extracting every metric you can think of: mean, std, max, min, difference of maximum and minimum values, median, median absolute deviation, number of peaks, skewness, kurtosis, etc, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wide range of time series feature extraction packages available in Python. Some examples are [**tsfresh**](https://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/), [**featuretools**](https://featuretools.alteryx.com/en/stable/getting_started/handling_time.html#Handling-Time) (not just time series), [**tsfel**](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/), and Facebook's [**kats**](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/) which is very comprehensive but not as lightweight as it claims (it offers forecasting, detection, and time series feature extraction but because it depends on STAN and PyStan, you may have issues using it on Windows—especially on corporate IT systems that are locked down). You can get a sense of the typical features that you can extract from these packages from the default list of [features extracted by **tsfresh**](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/descriptions/feature_list.html)."
