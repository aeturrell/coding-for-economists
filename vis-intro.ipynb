    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you'll see how to make plots that present data in an engaging and informative way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a plethora of options (and packages) for data visualisation using code. First, though a note about the different *philosophies* of data visualisation. There are broadly two categories of approach to using code to create data visualisations: *imperative*, where you build what you want, and *declarative*, where you say what you want. Choosing which to use involves a trade-off: imperative libraries offer you flexibility but at the cost of some verbosity; declarative libraries offer you a quick way to plot your data, but only if it's in the right format to begin with, and customisation may be more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also different purposes of data visualisation. It can be useful to bear in mind the three broad categories of visualisation that are out there:\n",
    "\n",
    "- exploratory\n",
    "\n",
    "- scientific\n",
    "\n",
    "- narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "Python excels at exploratory and scientific visualisation. The tools for narrative visualisation are not as good as they could be for making common chart types efficiently, but the endless customisability of one particular Python package (**matplotlib**) means you can always get the effect you need (with some work).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of the three kinds of vis, *exploratory visualisation*, is the kind that you do when you're looking and data and trying to understand it. Just plotting the data is a really good strategy for getting a feel for any issues there might be. This is perhaps most famously demonstrated by *Anscombe's quartet*: four different datasets with the same mean, standard deviation, and correlation but *very* different data distributions.\n",

It's the kind of plot you might include in a more technical paper, the picture that says a thousand words. I often think of the first image of a black hole {cite}`akiyama2019first` as a prime example of this. You can get away with having a high density of information in a scientific plot and, in short format journals, you may need to. The journal *Physical Review Letters*, which has an 8 page limit, has a classic of this genre in more or less every issue. Ensuring that important values can be accurately read from the plot is especially important in these kinds of charts. But they can also be the kind of plot that presents the killer results in a study; they might not be exciting to people who don't look at charts for a living, but they might be exciting and, just as importantly, understandable by your peers.\n",

    "### Narrative Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and final kind is narrative visualisation. This is the one that requires the most thought in the step where you go from the first view to the end product. It's a visualisation that doesn't just show a picture, but gives an insight. These are the kind of visualisations that you might see in the *Financial Times*, *The Economist*, or on the BBC News website. They come with aids that help the viewer focus on the aspects that the creator wanted them to (you can think of these aids or focuses as doing for visualisation what bold font does for text). They're well worth using in your work, especially if you're trying to communicate a particular narrative, and especially if the people you're communicating with don't have deep knowledge of the topic. You might use them in a paper that you hope will have a wide readership, in a blog post summarising your work, or in a report intended for a policymaker.\n",

    "## Quick guide to data visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing data visualisation, a huge topic in itself, is definitely out of scope for this book! But it's worth discussing a few general pointers at the outset that will serve you very well if you follow them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A picture may tell a 1000 words, but you've got to be a bit careful about what those words are. The first question you should ask yourself when it comes to data visualisation is 'what does this plot tell the viewer?', ie what do you want people to take away from your chart. That nugget of information should be as apparent as possible from the plot. Then you want to ensure that people *do* take away what you meant them to; the viewer should be left in little doubt about what you are saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor to bear in mind is that papers typically don't have more than, say, ten plots in them--and frequently fewer than that. So each one must count and advance the narrative of your work somehow. (Easier to say, hard to do in practice.) As an example, if you have data that are normally distributed, and you want to show this, it's probably not worth showing it on a plot. But if you had two distributions whose differences were important for the overall story you were telling, that might be something to highlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are more practical matters: is this plot better done as a scatter plot or a line? Should I stack my bar chart or split out the contributions? Those questions address the *type* of plot you're creating. For example, if you have observations that are independent from one another, with no auto-correlation along the x-axis, a scatter plot is more appropriate than a line chart. However, for time series, which tend to exhibit a high degree of auto-correlation, a line chart could be just the thing. As well as the overall type, for example scatter plot, you can think about adding more information through the use of colours, shapes, sizes, and so on. But my advice is always to be sparing with extra dimensions of information as it very quickly becomes difficult to read. In most cases, an x-axis, a y-axis, and, usually, one other dimension (eg colour) will be the best option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've decided on the *type* of chart, you can then think about smaller details. Unfortunately, lack of labels is endemic in economics (\"percent of what!?\", I cry at least three times a day). Always make what you're plotting clear and, if it has units, express them (eg \"Salary (2015 USD)\"). Think carefully about the tick labels to use too; you'll want something quite different for linear versus log plots. Titles can be helpful too, if the axes labels and the chart by themselves don't tell the whole story. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if there are very specific features you'd like to draw attention to, you can achieve this with text labels (as used liberally in the data visualisations you'll see in newspapers like the *Financial Times*), greying out all but the most interesting data point, etc.; anything that singles out one part of the chart as the interesting one. A common trick is to plot the less important features with greater transparency and the important line/point/bar with solid colour. These all have the effect of drawing the eye straight to where it should spend the most time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just the briefest of brief overviews of what you should bear in mind for good visualisation; I highly recommend the short and delightful [Fundamentals of Data visualisation](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) if you'd like to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of further resources to help you choose the right plot for the occassion, you can't go too far wrong than the [*Financial Times* Visual Vocabulary of charts](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/tree/master/visual-vocabulary). And, please, please use [vector graphics](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/image-file-formats.html) whenever you can!"

    "### Colour\n",
    "\n",
    "This section has benefitted from this [blog piece](https://blog.datawrapper.de/which-color-scale-to-use-in-data-vis/) on visualisation and colour, and you can find more information there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colours often make a chart come alive, but, when encoding differences with colour, think carefully about what would serve your audience and message best. It's best not to use colour randomly, but to choose colours that either add information to the chart or get out of the way of the message. Often, you'll want to draw your colours from a 'colour palette', a collection of different colours that work together to create a particular effect. The best colour palettes take into account that colour blindness is a problem for many people, and they remain informative even when converted to greyscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular Python visualisation libraries, **matplotlib**, comes with a wide range of colour palettes available [here](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) and you can find another good package for colour palettes [here](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For (unordered) categorical data, visually distinct colour palettes (also known as qualitative palettes) are better. The basic rule is that you should use distinct hues when your values don’t have an inherent order or range. Note that this does not include Likert scales (“strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree”), because even though there are distinct categories, there is an order to the possible responses.\n",

    "## Libraries for data visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this chapter, we'll take a look at making visualisations with several of these libraries. But first, let's introduce them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important and widely used data visualisation library in Python is [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/). It was used to make the first image of a black hole {cite}`akiyama2019first` and to image the first empirical evidence of gravitational waves {cite}`abbott2016observation`. **matplotlib** is an imperative visualisation library: you specify each part of what you want individually to build up an entire picture. It's perhaps the easiest to get started with and the most difficult to master. As well as making plots, it can also be used to make diagrams, animations, and 3D visualisations (which you should use sparingly, if at all).\n",
    "\n",
    "[**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) is a popular declarative library that builds on **maplotlib** and works especially well with data that are in a *tidy* format (one row per observation, one column per variable). I tend to use a mixture of **seaborn** and **matplotlib** in my work.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**plotnine**](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is another declarative plotting library but, rather than having lots of different functions (eg 'boxplot', 'violinplot', 'scatterplot') as **seaborn** does, it adopts a *grammar of graphics* approach. What this means is that *all* visualisations begin with the same command, `ggplot`, and are combinations of layers that address different aspects of a plot, for example points or lines, scale, labels, and so on. It'll be clearer when we come to an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**altair**](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is yet another declarative plotting library for Python! It's most suited to interactive graphics on the web, and produces really beautiful charts. Under the hood, it calls a javascript library named **Vega-Lite** that's the sort of thing newspaper data visualisation units might use to make their infographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pandas** also has built-in plotting functions that you will have seen in the data analysis part of this book. They are of the form `df.plot.*` where `*` could be, for example, `scatter`. These are convenience functions for making a quick plot of your data and they actually use **matplotlib**; we won't see much of these here but you can find them in the data analysis chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start this chapter by finding out a little bit more about each of these data visualisation libraries before looking at some examples of how to make specific plots with all the main libraries. We'll end by looking at some more interesting and advanced plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more in-depth introduction to matplotlib, head over to [this tutorial](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these libraries has their own default theme for how it shows plots. Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the **matplotlib** default so the first thing I do is to change it to something more aesthetically pleasing and that uses the kind of fonts you'll see in a paper compiled with latex."

You should think of the figure object, `fig`, as the canvas on which you can put any number of charts. Each ax (short for 'axis') object is one chart within a figure. Of course, most of the time you're likely only to have one axis per figure, but in the cases when you don't it's a really useful setup. The plotting of elements such as lines, points, bars, and so, are controlled by the `ax` objects while the overall settings are controlled by `fig`.\n",

    "- Figure, or 'fig': the figure keeps track of all the child Axes that are on it and a smattering of 'special' artists (titles, figure legends, etc). A figure can contain any number of Axes, but will typically have at least one.\n",
    "- Axes, or 'ax': this is the plot, the region of the image that traces out the data. A given Figure can contain many Axes, but a given Axes object can only be in one Figure. The Axes contains two (or three in the case of 3D) Axis objects (Axes and Axis are different things!) that record the data limits (you can override these via the `axes.Axes.set_xlim()` and `axes.Axes.set_ylim()` methods). Each Axes object has a title (set via `set_title()`), an x-label (set via `set_xlabel()`), and a y-label set via `set_ylabel()`). When you add, say, a line chart to an Axes object it appears as a Line2D object associated that that axis and it is created by calling a method on an Axes object.\n",
    "- Axis: these are the number-line objects that control the limits of what the viewer can see. They also provide the means to access the ticks (the marks on the axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks). The location of the ticks is determined by a Locator object and the ticklabel strings are formatted by a Formatter. The combination of Locator and Formatter gives very fine control over the tick locations and labels.\n",

The object-oriented structure of **matplotlib** plots can be confusing at first, but, as we'll see, it pretty much fades into the background when you're making plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **matplotlib** is super-customisable, sometimes achieving what you want directly can be a bit verbose. Let's say we want to now differentiate these points with colour according to which state they belong to and add a legend that says which states have which colour. The easiest way to do this is by creating a for loop."

The first is that we asked for more rows and columns from matplotlib using `plt.subplots(nrows, ncolumns)` and instead of returning a single `ax` it returned a list of axes (here of length 2). We then iterated over those axes using enumerate, which gives an integer `i` and an `ax` from the list, and plotted a column on each axis by subsetting the dataframe one column at a time using `df.iloc[:, i]`. Remember that the first position in `iloc` is for the index values (ie the rows), while the second is for the columns. Again, this was quite a lot of code to get a relatively simple chart done!

The point of this library is to take some of the verbosity out of **matplotlib**:\n",

    "> ProPlot’s core mission is to provide a smoother plotting experience for matplotlib’s heaviest users. We accomplish this by expanding upon the object-oriented matplotlib API. ProPlot makes changes that would be hard to justify or difficult to incorporate into matplotlib itself, owing to differing design choices and backwards compatibility considerations.\n",
