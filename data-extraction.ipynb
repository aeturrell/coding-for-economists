    "Using an API (application programming interface) is another way to draw down information from the interweb. Their just a way for one tool, say Python, to speak to another tool, say a server, and usefully exchange information. The classic use case would be to post a request for data that fits a certain query via an API and to get a download of that data back in return. (You should always preferentially use an API over webscraping a site.)\n",

    "An API key is needed in order to access some APIs. Sometimes all you need to do is register with site, in other cases you may have to pay for access.\n",

    "\n",
    " To see this, let's directly use an API to get some time series data. We will make the call out to the internet using the **requests** package.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API has an 'endpoint', the base url, and then a URL that encodes the question. Let's see an example with the ONS API for which the endpoint is \"https://api.ons.gov.uk/\". The rest of the API has the form 'key/value', for example we'll ask for timeseries data 'timeseries' followed by 'JP9Z' for the vacancies in the UK services sector. We then ask for 'dataset' followed by 'UNEM' to specify which overarching dataset the series we want is in. The last part asks for the data with 'data'. Often you won't need to know all of these details, but it's useful to see a detailed example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that are returned by APIs are typically in JSON format, which looks a lot like a nested Python dictionary and its entries can be accessed in the same way--this is what is happening when getting the series' title in the example below. JSON is not good for analysis, so we'll use **pandas** to put the data into shape."

    "## Webscraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Webscraping is a way of grabbing information from the internet that was intended to be displayed in a browser. But it should only be used as a last resort, and only then when permitted by the terms and conditions of a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're getting data from the internet, it's much better to use an API whenever you can: grabbing information in a structure way is *exactly* why APIs exist. APIs should also be more stable than websites, which may change frequently. Typically, if an organisation is happy for you to grab their data, they will have made an API expressly for that purpose. I'd say it's pretty rare that there's a major website which *does* permit webscraping but which doesn't have an API; for these websites, if they don't have an API, chances scraping is against their terms and conditions. Those terms and conditions may be enforceable by law (different rules in different countries here, and you really need legal advice if it's not unambiguous as to whether you can scrape or not.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other reasons why webscraping is not so good; for example, if you need a back-run then it might be offered through an API but not shown on the webpage. (Or it might not be available at all, in which case it's best to get in touch with the organisation or check out WaybackMachine in case they took snapshots).\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm pretty down on webscraping as there's almost always a better solution. However, there are occasionally times when it is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do find yourself in a scraping situation, be really sure to check that's legally allowed and also that you are not violating the website's `robots.txt` rules: this is a special file on almost every website that sets out what's fair play to crawl (conditional on legality) and what robots should not go poking around in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you are spoiled for choice when it comes to webscraping. There are five very strong libraries that cover a real range of user styles and needs: **requests**, **lxml**, **beautifulsoup**, **selenium**, and *scrapy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For quick and simple webscraping, my usual combo would **requests**, which does little more than go and grab the HTML of a webpage, and **beautifulsoup**, which then helps you to navigate the structure of the page and pull out what you're actually interested in. For dynamic webpages that use javascript rather than just HTML, you'll need **selenium**. To scale up and hit thousands of webpages in an efficient way, you might try **scrapy**, which can work with the other tools and handle multiple sessions, and all other kinds of bells and whistles... it's actually a \"web scraping framework\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always helpful to see coding in practice, so that's what we'll do now, but note that we'll be skipping over a lot of important detail such as user agents, being 'polite' with your scraping requests, being efficient with caching and crawling.\n",
