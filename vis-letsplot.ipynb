    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you'll see how to make plots quickly using the *declarative* plotting package **[lets-plot](https://lets-plot.org/)**. This package is perfect if you want to make a standard chart from so-called *tidy* data where you have one row per observation and one columnn per variable. This chapter has benefitted from the book *ggplot: elegant graphics for data analysis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**lets-plot** is the quickest way to get going with plots in Python.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "To install **lets-plot**, run `pip install lets-plot` on the command line. We're also going to be using the Palmer Penguins dataset, so you'll need to run `pip install palmerpenguins` too.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some background information that you might find useful in getting to grips with **lets-plot**. All plots are composed of the data, the information you want to visualise, and a mapping: the description of how the data’s variables are mapped to aesthetic attributes. There are five mapping components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *layer* is a collection of geometric elements and statistical transformations. Geometric elements, *geoms* for short, represent what you actually see in the plot: points, lines, polygons, etc. Statistical transformations, *stats* for short, summarise the data: for example, binning and counting observations to create a histogram, or fitting a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Scales* map values in the data space to values in the aesthetic space. This includes the use of colour, shape or size. Scales also draw the legend and axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *coord*, or coordinate system, describes how data coordinates are mapped to the plane of the graphic. It also provides axes and gridlines to help read the graph. We normally use the Cartesian coordinate system, but a number of others are available, including polar coordinates and map projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *facet* specifies how to break up and display subsets of data as small multiples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *theme* controls the finer points of display, like the font size and background colour. While the defaults have been chosen with care, you may need to consult other references to create an attractive plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "As ever, we're going to load the packages we'll be using."
