    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll do a whistlestop tour of data analysis in Python using a structure called a *dataframe*. Dataframes do everything a spreadsheet does, and a *whole lot more*. At their simplest, dataframes are a tabular representation of data with rows and columns. The data in each column can be anything; text, numbers, Python objects such as lists or dictionaries, or even other dataframes!\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to extract, clean, and analyse data is one of the core skills any economist needs. Fortunately, the (open source) tools that are available for data analysis have improved enormously in recent years, and working with them can be a delight——even the most badly formatted data can be beaten into shape. You may be sceptical that these open source tools can be as powerful as the costly, closed source tools you may already know: but, over time, you'll come to see how they do far, far more, and do it faster too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll see analysis on a *single* dataframe using the Star Wars' characters dataset as an example. For a more thorough grounding in using data, see the next chapter ({ref}`working-with-data`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter uses the [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [**numpy**](https://numpy.org/) packages. If you're running this code, you may need to install these packages. If you don't have these installed, you can install them by running either `uv add packagename` on your computer's command line (the instructions are `conda install packagename` if you're using Miniconda). You can find a brief guide to installing packages in {ref}`code-preliminaries`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is hugely indebted to the fantastic [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), and both the **pandas** [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) and amazing [introductory tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html).\n",
