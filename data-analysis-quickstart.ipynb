    "\n",
    "Here we'll do a whistlestop tour of data analysis in Python using a structure called a *dataframe*. Dataframes do everything a spreadsheet does, and a whole lot more. At their simplest, dataframes are a tabular representation of data with rows and columns. The data in each column can be anything; text, numbers, Python objects such as lists or dictionaries, or even other dataframes!\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to extract, clean, and analyse data is one of the core skills any economist needs. Fortunately, the (open source) tools that are available for data analysis have improved enormously in recent years, and working with them can be a delight——even the most badly formatted data can be beaten into shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll see analysis on a *single* dataframe using the Star Wars' characters dataset as an example. For a more thorough grounding in using data, see the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter uses the [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [**numpy**](https://numpy.org/) packages. If you're running this code, you may need to install these packages. The Anaconda distribution of Python comes with **pandas** and **numpy** installed. If you don't have these installed, you can install them by running either `conda install packagename` or `pip install packagename` on your computer's command line. You can find a brief guide to installing packages on {ref}`code-preliminaries`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is hugely indebted to the fantastic [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), and both the **pandas** [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) and amazing [introductory tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html).\n",
