    "\n",
    "In this mini-project we will aim to explain how *interest rates affect the selling price of houses*. **Big caveat**: this is *not* supposed to be a robust piece of analysis or a full-fledged research project; it's just a demonstration of some techniques and how to weave them together. If you were actually thinking about this problem there's a lot more that you'd want to take into account. You should not take the results of this analysis too seriously!\n",
    "\n",
    "In our exploration of this problem, we'll use house prices as sold from Ames, Iowa. This is mostly for convenience because there's a [Kaggle]() competition that uses this data, so it's publicly available (we'll be using the *train* version of the dataset). But it's worth noting that house prices as sold are different from house prices as advertised--they are prices that someone was willing to pay! They are at the equilibrium point in the supply-demand curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Housing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think for a moment about how we're going to tackle this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, not all houses are created equal. They are not a commodity; they're hugely heterogeneous. We might not expect the construction of a 15 bed mansion with a pool and underground cinema to affect the supply or demand for a 1 bed studio apartment (though it might say something about general economic conditions!). So we must also control for the many effects that might influence the price of a house, such as the number of bedrooms, whether or not it is in good shape, and whether or not it has an underground cinema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Against type, we've considered heterogeneity before supply and demand. We should of course also expect the price of houses to vary in accordance with the supply and demand of housing, which means we must take into account any factors that change supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it's also useful to consider housing as an asset. This [paper] shows that it had one of the best rates of return over 19xx-19xx. Housing can yield rent for landlords or, implicitly, a *user cost* for homeowners--that is a rent you 'pay' to yourself for living in the house you own. If housing is an asset, it's going to be affected by the price of other assets. We should therefore track the rate of return on other asstes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand for housing is going to depend on the number of people, their propensity to live in close quarters with one another, how well-off people are (or expect to be), \n",
    "\n",
    "Costs incurred to maintain the property, including depreciation, maintenance, and insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supply\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious factor is the supply of housing, i.e. are lots of new homes being built? We should put in a factor that captures this. We should also consider how well occupied *existing* housing is, so we'll incorporate a measure of how many vacant units there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IAHVAC - housing vacancy\n",
    "\n",
    "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IARVAC - rental vacancy\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another channel for supply to change. Over a long period of time, an unanticipated fall in real yields on other assets might make housing relatively more attractive, pushing up house prices. Eventually, we'd expect this to generate extra housing supply. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, we'll be taking interest rates into account, because that's the relationship we're interested in. But we might also need to think about whether people have access to credit in order to get a mortgage, how well people are doing in general (and, perhaps, how well they expect to do in the future), and whether lots of new houses are being built.\n",

Fortunately, there are powerful open source solutions to load data in almost any format you can think of. And, in my experience, almost every data cleaning operation is different so bear in mind that in this example you'll just see *one* way that data cleaning might occur.\n",

    "- HDF5\n",

    "The standard way to call this library in is via `import pandas as pd`. You can give whatever name you like to packages you import (for example, you could `import pandas as supercalifragilisticexpialidocious`), but there are a few conventions around for the very popular packages like **pandas** and shorter import names are going to save you time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always easier to read in neatly formatted data but so often we find that real-world data is messy and needs a bit of work to get into shape. To demonstrate how this works in practice, we're going to work with a messy dataset and show how to read it in. You'll have probably heard that 80% of data science is cleaning the data--well it's true for empirical economics too!\n",
