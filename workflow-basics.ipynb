    "\n",
    "Using the \"Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window\" option or using the shortcut will cause panel 5 in the above diagram (the interactive window) to appear, where you will see the code run and the outputs of your script appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "If you have an issue getting the code to run in the interactive window, first check the instructions in {ref}`code-preliminaries`. If you're still having issues, it may be that Visual Studio Code isn't sure which Python to run, or where Python is on your system. To fix the latter problem, hit the \"Select kernel\" button in the top right-hand side of the interactive window.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are first writing a script, it's useful to be able to move back and forth between the script and the interactive window. You might execute a line of code (put the cursor on the relevant line and hit shift and enter) in the interactive window, then manually write out some code in the interactive window's execution box (seen at the bottom of panel 5 saying \"Type code here...\"), and then explore some of the variables you've created with the variable explorer (using the button \"Variables\") at the top of the interactive window.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, once you've honed the code in your script, it's good to make the script a complete analytical process that you are happy running end-to-end and that—for production or 'final' work—you would use the \"Run Current File in Interactive Window\" option to run all the way through. This is good practice because *what is in your script is reproducible* but what you've entered manually in the interactive window is not. And you want the outputs from your code to be reproducible and understandable by others (including future you!), but this is hard if there are undocumented extra lines of code that you only did on the fly via the interactive window's execution box."

    "We already saw how to install packages in {ref}`code-preliminaries`. If you forgot, look back at how to do this now. In short, packages are installed using the command line or, on Windows, the Anaconda prompt. With either of these open, type `conda install packagename` and hit enter to both search for and install the package you need.\n",

    "What about using a package that you've installed? That's what we'll look at now.\n",

    "Let's see an example of using the powerful numerical library **numpy**. There are different ways to import packages to use within a script or notebook; you can import the entire package in one go or just import the functions you need (if you know their names). When an entire package is imported, you can give it any name you like and the convention for **numpy** is to import it as the shortened 'np'. All of the functions and methods of the package can be accessed by typing `np` followed by `.` and then typing the function name. This convention of importing packages with a given name makes your code easier to read, because you know exactly which package is doing what, and avoids any conflicts when functions from different packages have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as demonstrating importing the whole package for **numpy**, the example below shows importing just one specific function from **numpy**, `inv`, which does matrix inversion. Note that because `inv` was imported separately it can be used without an `np` prefix."
