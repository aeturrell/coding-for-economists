    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A huge amount of data lives in databases, so it's essential that you know how to access them. Sometimes you can ask someone to download a snapshot into a .csv for you, but this gets painful quickly: every time you need to make a change you'll have to communicate with another human. You want to be able to reach into the database directly to get the data you need, when you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll first learn the basics of Python packages that can interact with SQL databses: how to use them to connect to a database and then retrieve data with a SQL[^import-databases-1] query. **SQL**, short for **s**tructured **q**uery **l**anguage, is the lingua franca of databases, and is an important language for all data scientists to learn. You won't become a SQL master by the end of the chapter, but you will be able to identify the most important components and understand what they do.\n",

    "## Database Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "At the simplest level, you can think about a database as a collection of data frames, called **tables** in database terminology.\n",
    "Like a **pandas** dataframe, a database table is a collection of named columns, where every value in the column is the same type.\n",
    "There are three high level differences between data frames and database tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Database tables are stored on disk (ie on file) and can be arbitrarily large.\n",
    "    Data frames are stored in memory, and are fundamentally limited (although that limit is still big enough for many problems). You can think about the difference between on disk and in memory as being like the difference between long-term and short-term memory (and you have much more limited capacity in the latter).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Database tables almost always have indexes.\n",
    "    Much like the index of a book, a database index makes it possible to quickly find rows of interest without having to look at every single row.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Most classical databases are optimised for rapidly collecting data, not analysing existing data.\n",
    "    These databases are called **row-oriented** because the data is stored row-by-row, rather than column-by-column.\n",
    "    More recently, there's been much development of **column-oriented** databases that make analysing the existing data much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are run by database management systems (**DBMS**'s for short), which come in three basic forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *Client-server* DBMS's run on a powerful central server, which you connect from your computer (the client). They are great for sharing data with multiple people in an organisation. Popular client-server DBMS's include PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, and Oracle.\n",
    "-   *Cloud* DBMS's, like Snowflake, Amazon's RedShift, and Google's BigQuery, are similar to client server DBMS's, but they run in the cloud. This means that they can easily handle extremely large datasets and can automatically provide more compute resources as needed.\n",
    "-   *In-process* DBMS's, like SQLite or duckdb, run entirely on your computer. They're great for working with large datasets where you're the primary user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to a database from Python, there are a number of options, but it does depend on what *kind* of database you are connecting to. The steps (eg connect to the database, upload data, run SQL series) are similar though, so we won't lose much by just choosing one example—a SQLite database. SQLite is a small, fast, self-contained, SQL database engine and the most used database engine in the world. A lot of the data on your computer and mobile phone will in fact be in SQLite databases. (Simon Willison has some [great tools](https://dogsheep.github.io/) to help export some of the data that you've created!)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will always need two steps though, regardless of what kind of SQL database we are connecting to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You'll always use a database interface that provides a connection to the database, for example Python's built-in **sqlite** package\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You'll also use a package that pushes and/or pulls data to/from the database, for example **pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "The precise details of the connection varies a lot from DBMS to DBMS so unfortunately we can't cover all the details here. The initial setup will often take a little fiddling (and maybe some research) to get right, but you'll generally only need to do it once. We'll do the best we can to cover some basics here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up a client-server or cloud DBMS would be a pain for this book, so we'll instead use an in-computer DBMS."

    "## Basic SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "A full description of SQL queries is outside the scope of this book, but we'll try and arm you with the basics.  The top-level components of SQL are called **statements**. Common statements include `CREATE` for defining new tables, `INSERT` for adding data, and `SELECT` for retrieving data. We will on focus on `SELECT` statements, also called **queries**, because they are almost exclusively what you'll use as a data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "A query is made up of **clauses**. There are six important clauses: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `LIMIT`. Every query must have the `SELECT`[^import-databases-4] and `FROM`[^import-databases-5] clauses and the simplest query is `SELECT * FROM table`, which selects all columns from a specified table called \"table\". `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` control which rows are included and how they are ordered. `GROUP BY` converts the query to a summary, causing aggregation to happen. `LIMIT` limits how many rows are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: in SQL, the order matters. You must always write the clauses in the order `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`. Confusingly, this order doesn't match how the clauses actually evaluated which is first `FROM`, then `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `SELECT`, and `ORDER BY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[^import-databases-4]: Confusingly, depending on the context, `SELECT` is either a statement or a clause.\n",
    "    To avoid this confusion, we'll generally use query instead of `SELECT` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^import-databases-5]: Technically, only the `SELECT` is required, since you can write queries like `SELECT 1+1` to perform basic calculations. But if you want to work with data (as you always do!) you'll also need a `FROM` clause.\n",

    "-   [*SQL for Data Scientists*](https://sqlfordatascientists.com) by Renée M. P. Teate is an introduction to SQL designed specifically for the needs of data scientists, and includes examples of the sort of highly interconnected data you're likely to encounter in real organisations.\n",
    "-   [*Practical SQL*](https://www.practicalsql.com) by Anthony DeBarros is written from the perspective of a data journalist (a data scientist specialised in telling compelling stories) and goes into more detail about getting your data into a database and running your own DBMS.\n",
    "-   Check out one of the many [*sql cheatsheets*](https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-basics-cheat-sheet/sql-basics-cheat-sheet-a3.pdf) that have all of the basics written in one place\n",
