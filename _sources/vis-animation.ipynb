    "# Animation\n",
    "\n",
    "Animations can be an effective way to show an extra dimension of your data, especially changes over time. Clearly, they're not appropriate everywhere, eg in static media! For various reasons, they should be used sparingly, but-used rarely and with care-they can convey a message about data more effectively than a static chart ever would. Perhaps the most famous example of an animated chart is the legendary Hans Roslings' [gapminder animation](https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo?t=29) covering 200 countries and 200 years of progress in income and health.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common scenario for wanting to create an animation is sharing on social media (gifs are ubiquitous on the internet) or displaying an animation of some of your results during a talk. In both these cases, creating a gif is probably the best and safest option. 'The best' because although video files tend to be very large (and thus difficult to share), gifs can be turned into small files, with a bit of tweaking. 'The safest' because even though presentation software like Microsoft's Powerpoint can crumble when trying to play an embedded video file, gifs usually work just fine. And while video formats differ across operating systems, all of them will play gifs (all you need to play a gif is a browser such as Safari or Chrome).  However, you can also create animations in other video formats, such as .mp4. The main downside of gifs is that they can produce quite jerky videos.\n",

    "Let's create individual images and index them with $i$. We want to move on to a new scene every time we increment $i$. We do this by creating a *function* that accepts $i$ as a parameter and that modifies what is shown on the image. The below example shows how it can work: although the $x$ and $y$ arrays are always defined, and an $x$-$y$ line plot is always shown, the `ax.scatter()` function is passed only the $i$th element of the $x$ and $y$ arrays. When we call `plot_scene()` with different values of $i$, the scene updates to the next moment in time. In the example below, the bead moves along 1/20th of its journey between 0 and $2\\pi$.\n"

    "\n",
    "The [**gif**](https://github.com/maxhumber/gif) package is here to make it as easy as possible to create gifs from a series of plot images created using **matplotlib**, **altair**, or **plotly**. (In principle, this should also work for **plotnine** as it's built on top of **matplotlib**). To install it, use `pip install gif` on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**gif** works by using function decorators (you can learn more about these in the advanced coding chapter). These 'decorate' existing functions using an `@` symbol and change their behaviour. In this case, the decorator is `@git.frame` and it tells **gif** to remember this function as one frame of a gif.\n",

    "- use a high resolution when creating the gif, as high as 900 dots per inch. In the below we use a quite large 400 dots per inch to save a bit of space but it still gives a hefty file size. However...\n",
    "- ...you can use an optimizer to then shrink that finished high res gif down to a more respectable size. In the below, [**pygifsicle**](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/pygifsicle) is used to do this, a package that you will need to install separately. In our example, this takes the gif down to under 1MB.\n",
