    "# Introduction to Text\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers how to use code to work with text as data, including opening files with text in, changing and cleaning text, and vectorised operations on text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has benefitted from the [Python String Cook Book](https://mkaz.blog/code/python-string-format-cookbook/) and Jake VanderPlas' [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.10-working-with-strings.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that regexes are mentioned a few times in this chapter; you'll find out much more about them in the {ref}`text-regex` chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An aside on encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to the good stuff, we need to talk about string encodings. Whether you're using code or a text editor (Notepad, Word, Pages, Visual Studio Code), every bit of text that you see on a computer will have an encoding behind the scenes that tells the computer how to display the underlying data. There is no such thing as 'plain' text: all text on computers is the result of an encoding. Oftentimes, a computer programme (email reader, Word, whatever) will guess the encoding and show you what it thinks the text should look like. But it doesn't always know, or get it right: *that is what is happening when you get an email or open a file full of weird symbols and question marks*. If a computer doesn't know whether a particular string is encoded using UTF-8 or ASCII or ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) or Windows 1252 (Western European), it simply cannot display it correctly and you get gibberish.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to encodings, there are just two things to remember: i) you should use UTF-8 (aka Unicode), it's the international standard. ii) the Windows operating system tends to use either Latin 1 or Windows 1252 but (and this is good news) is moving to UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/) is a specification that aims to list every character used by human languages and give each character its own unique code. The Unicode specifications are continually revised and updated to add new languages and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take special care when saving CSV files containing text on a Windows machine using Excel; unless you specify it, the text may not be saved in UTF-8. If your computer and you get confused enough about encodings and re-save a file with the wrong ones, you could lose data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully you'll never have to worry about string encodings. But if you *do* see weird symbols appearing in your text, at least you'll know that there's an encoding problem and will know where to start Googling. You can find a much more in-depth explanation of text encodings [here](https://kunststube.net/encoding/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are many built-in functions for using strings in Python, you can find a comprehensive list [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are the basic data type for text in Python. They can be of any length. A string can be signalled by quote marks or double quote marks like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "`'text'`\n",
