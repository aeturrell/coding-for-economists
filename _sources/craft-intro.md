# Introduction

This section is a little different from the rest of the book as it's about the the *craft* of research rather than coding. The chapters in this section definitely don't fit thematically with the rest of the book but they are *useful*, and that's why they're here. (Eventually, we may find a better home for them.)

If you want a weak rationale (and it is weak), then coding involves assembling a set of instructions in order to produce the effect you desire; when communicating factual information, there are tips and instructions that you can follow that will *also* help you achieve the outcome you'd like, and we're presenting some of these here. The aim here is to bring down the barriers to good, clear, and effective work by sharing tips.

So the rest of this section covers some of the craft of exploration, research, and analysis, especially when it interfaces closely with codingâ€”but sometimes when it's just generally important for your work.
