    "## Obtaining data using APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an API (application programming interface) is another way to draw down information from the interweb. Their just a way for one tool, say Python, to speak to another tool, say a server, and usefully exchange information. The classic use case would be to post a request for data that fits a certain query via an API and to get a download of that data back in return. (You should always preferentially use an API over webscraping a siteâ€”you can read more about [why APIs are so great here](https://aeturrell.com/blog/posts/the-prize-with-apis/the-prize-with-apis.html).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are designed to work with any tool, you don't actually need a programming language to interact with an API, it's just a *lot* easier if you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "An API key is needed in order to access some APIs. Sometimes all you need to do is register with site, in other cases you may have to pay for access.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, let's directly use an API to get some time series data. We will make the call out to the internet using the **requests** package.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API has an 'endpoint', the base url, and then a URL that encodes the question. Let's see an example with the ONS API for which the endpoint is \"https://api.beta.ons.gov.uk/v1\". There's then the information that filters down to the specific time series we're interested in. This is a long string! For the ONS API, if you ever wish to search for the 'data' part of the API call, you can also use the API to search for that time series by its ID. For example, to get the full URL of the vacancy postings in the service sector below, we first had to run \"https://api.beta.ons.gov.uk/v1/search?content_type=timeseries&cdids=JP9Z\" in a browser and extra the \"uri\" part. The uri part then forms the end of the API call, forming a complete URL. You can check all of these URLs yourself by pasting them into your internet browser's address bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that are returned by APIs are typically in JSON format, which looks a lot like a nested Python dictionary and its entries can be accessed in the same way--this is what is happening when getting the series' title in the example below. JSON is not good for analysis, so we'll use **pandas** to put the data into shape."

    "Sometimes it's convenient to use APIs directly, and, as an example, the OECD API comes with a LOT of complexity that direct access can take advantage of. The OECD API makes data available in both JSON and XML formats, and we'll use [**pandasdmx**](https://pandasdmx.readthedocs.io/) (aka the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX) package for the Python data ecosystem) to pull down the XML format data and turn it into a regular **pandas** dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, key to using the OECD API is knowledge of its many codes: for countries, times, resources, and series. You can find some broad guidance on what codes the API uses [here](https://data.oecd.org/api/sdmx-ml-documentation/) but to find exactly what you need can be a bit tricky. Two tips are:\n",
    "1. If you know what you're looking for is in a particular named dataset, eg \"QNA\" (Quarterly National Accounts), put `https://stats.oecd.org/restsdmx/sdmx.ashx/GetDataStructure/QNA/all?format=SDMX-ML` into your browser and look through the XML file; you can pick out the sub-codes and the countries that are available.\n",
    "2. Browse around on https://stats.oecd.org/ and use Customise then check all the \"Use Codes\" boxes to see whatever your browsing's code names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of this in action. We'd like to see the productivity (GDP per hour) data for a range of countries since 2010. We are going to be in the productivity resource (code \"PDB_LV\") and we want the USD current prices (code \"CPC\") measure of GDP per employed worker (code \"T_GDPEMP) from 2010 onwards (code \"startTime=2010\"). We'll grab this for some developed countries where productivity measurements might be slightly more comparable. The comments below explain what's happening in each step."

    "\n",
    "Webscraping is a way of grabbing information from the internet that was intended to be displayed in a browser. But it should only be used as a last resort, and only then when permitted by the terms and conditions of a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're getting data from the internet, it's much better to use an API whenever you can: grabbing information in a structure way is *exactly* why APIs exist. APIs should also be more stable than websites, which may change frequently. Typically, if an organisation is happy for you to grab their data, they will have made an API expressly for that purpose. It's pretty rare that there's a major website which *does* permit webscraping but which doesn't have an API; for these websites, if they don't have an API, chances scraping is against their terms and conditions. Those terms and conditions may be enforceable by law (different rules in different countries here, and you really need legal advice if it's not unambiguous as to whether you can scrape or not.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other reasons why webscraping is not so good; for example, if you need a back-run then it might be offered through an API but not shown on the webpage. (Or it might not be available at all, in which case it's best to get in touch with the organisation or check out WaybackMachine in case they took snapshots).\n",
    "\n",
    "So this book is pretty down on webscraping as there's almost always a better solution. However, there are times when it is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do find yourself in a scraping situation, be really sure to check that's legally allowed and also that you are not violating the website's `robots.txt` rules: this is a special file on almost every website that sets out what's fair play to crawl (conditional on legality) and what robots should not go poking around in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you are spoiled for choice when it comes to webscraping. There are five very strong libraries that cover a real range of user styles and needs: **requests**, **lxml**, **beautifulsoup**, **selenium**, and *scrapy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For quick and simple webscraping, my usual combo would **requests**, which does little more than go and grab the HTML of a webpage, and **beautifulsoup**, which then helps you to navigate the structure of the page and pull out what you're actually interested in. For dynamic webpages that use javascript rather than just HTML, you'll need **selenium**. To scale up and hit thousands of webpages in an efficient way, you might try **scrapy**, which can work with the other tools and handle multiple sessions, and all other kinds of bells and whistles... it's actually a \"web scraping framework\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always helpful to see coding in practice, so that's what we'll do now, but note that we'll be skipping over a lot of important detail such as user agents, being 'polite' with your scraping requests, being efficient with caching and crawling.\n",

If you want to filter the list of tables, use the `match=` keyword argument with text that only appears in the table(s) you're interested in.\n",

    "The single best solution to grab tables is probably [**camelot**](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html). Note that it does need you to have Ghostscript installed on your computer; you can find more information about the dependencies [here](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install.html). It only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents: basically, if you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based. In that case, **camelot** is able to sift through the contents and grab any tables and then pass them back as csvs or even **pandas** dataframes.\n",

    "[**pdfcomments**](https://github.com/hoffmangroup/pdfcomments) is a library that allows you to strip out comments and sticky notes from PDF. This need not strictly be about data extraction, but [**PyPDF2**](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf) allows you to both split a PDF into separate pages and merge multiple PDFs together; see [here](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2018/04/11/splitting-and-merging-pdfs-with-python/) for the steps. (You can drag and drop pages using preview on MacOS but this library may be the easiest way to do the same thing on Windows.)"
