    "# Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll meet the lightweight markup language called *Markdown* that is very popular for lots of coding-related applications. For example, markdown is used to display the documentation for software packages and in the text cells of Jupyter Notebooks. Even this chapter is written in markdown!\n",
    "\n",
    "This book recommends [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a markdown editor. It can also render markdown files that are open; you'll need to install the **Markdown All in One** and **Markdown Preview Enhanced** extensions and then either right-click within a markdown file (extension `.md`) and choose *Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not using Visual Studio Code, you can experiment with Markdown in the text cells of Jupyter Notebooks in JupyterLab, in the text cells of Google Colab notebooks, or online via [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/), an online live-coding markdown environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is different from What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get document preparation software such as Microsoft Word because the *input* (a form of plain text) looks different from the rendered *output*. In Word, you click buttons to achieve the same formatting. When writing markdown, you specify the formatting elements of your documents with instructions that are, more or less, like code. If you're familiar with how raw HTML and rendered HTML look, it's a similar idea (and HTML is itself a markup language).\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown was created to be as readable as possible, even when you are writing it. It's also very simple, with few commands to remember: the idea is that you should focus on writing text rather than formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard extension for files that only contain markdown is `.md`, but you may also see `.qmd` in the context of markdown with executable code chunks. And you can find markdown in the cells of Jupyter notebooks (file extension `.ipynb`) too.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of situations where you may wish to use markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- repositories for software or research paper replications\n",
    "- to create websites, reports, and slides; see {ref}`quarto` for more on this\n",
    "- in the text cells of Jupyter Notebooks; see {ref}`code-where` for more on this\n",
    "- as a base format that tools like **pandoc** and **Quarto** can turn into other document types\n",
    "- to write books about coding for economists!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the advantages of markdown are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown files can be opened using by any plain text editor\n",
    "- Markdown is operating system independent\n",
    "- Markdown is very readable, even when not being rendered\n",
    "- Many websites support markdown syntax, eg GitHub (called Github-flavoured markdown) and Reddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this chapter will cover most of the markdown syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Markdown Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run through the basics of markdown. For example, a single hash (`#`) denotes the title of a document, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Heading\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level of sub-heading can be specified by two hashes, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "## Sub-heading\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each next level heading gets successively smaller, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phylum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Order\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Family\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phylum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Order\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Family\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Visual Studio Code, and you're on the explorer panel, you can see the outline (the structure of headings and sub-headings) of your markdown document under the 'outline' drop down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Line Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other common syntax features that you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- to create *italic* text, it's `*one asterisk on either side of the text*` \n",
    "- **bold** text is produced from `**two asterisks**`\n",
    "- ***bold italic*** is `***three asterisks***`\n",
    "- links are produced with square brackets for the text and parenthesis for the hyperlink, like this `[text](link)`\n",
    "- in-line code is shown by backticks, like this \\`code\\`\n",
    "- `~~strikethrough~~` looks like this ~~strikethrough~~\n",
    "- `^(superscript)` creates ^(superscript)\n",
    "- Maths is supported in-line via enclosing dollar signs, eg `${\\displaystyle ds^{2}=\\left(1-{\\frac {r_{\\mathrm {s} }}{r}}\\right)^{-1}\\,dr^{2}+r^{2}\\,d\\varphi ^{2}}$`, which renders as ${\\displaystyle ds^{2}=\\left(1-{\\frac {r_{\\mathrm {s} }}{r}}\\right)^{-1}\\,dr^{2}+r^{2}\\,d\\varphi ^{2}}$\n",
    "- Unicode is supported, so you can write symbols like ∰, as are emoji; syntax like `:tada:` creates :tada:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Block Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Quotes can be achieved by adding an arrow, `>`, to every line:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here is a quote!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unordered lists can be produced with either `-` or `*` on separate lines so that\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "- first item\n",
    "- second item\n",
    "- third item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- first item\n",
    "- second item\n",
    "- third item\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered lists can be created by simply writing successive numbers on successive lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "1. first item\n",
    "2. second item\n",
    "3. third item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. first item\n",
    "2. second item\n",
    "3. third item\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of list can be subsetted so that\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "- first item\n",
    "  - sub-item\n",
    "    - sub-sub-item\n",
    "- second item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- first item\n",
    "  - sub-item\n",
    "    - sub-sub-item\n",

    "but you will rarely want to write these out yourself! In practice, it's easiest to export a markdown file from a **pandas** dataframe using `df.to_markdown()` or use the handy website, [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).\n",

    "Note that there is syntax highlighting of data types and reserved keywords. The syntax highlighting supports a wide range of languages.
