# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

The easiest way to contribute is to give this book's [Github page a star](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists). You could also tweet/sky about it using the hashtags `#econtwitter`, `#econsky`, and `#datascience`. All of these help others find the book.

You can make suggestions, requests, and point out bugs or mistakes by [raising an issue](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/issues) on the GitHub repository for the book. We also welcome pull requests for corrections, typos, and code fixes.

If you're thinking of making a bigger contribution, say of a new page, it's usually best to open an issue before starting to work on anything. This will allow you a chance to talk the new content over with the maintainers of the site.

You can find more about contributing and how to build the book over on the GitHub [README](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists).
