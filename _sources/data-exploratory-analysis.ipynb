It also *seems* like the number of `Baths` column has some data issues because it is a floating point number rather than an integer. However, this a North American quirk: realtors refer to bathrooms with only a toilet and sink as a \"half bath\" (and sometimes those with a shower but no bathtub as a \"three-quarter bath,\" which also shows up in the data).

You should also know where to go for more in-depth, heavy duty exploratory data analysis reports, namely **ydata-profiling** and **dataprep**."
