    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapter was just a quick tour of what can be done with a single tabular dataset (a 'dataframe'). Dataframes are the most frequently used structure for working with data; they do everything a spreadsheet does and a whole lot more——as you'll see! In this chapter, we'll go deeper into working with data and dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll get really good overview to the [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package, the core data manipulation library in Python. There are other excellent packages for working with data in Python, for example **polars**, but there's none as ubiquitous. The name is derived from 'panel data' but it's suited to any tabular data, and can be used to work with more complex data structures too. We *won't* cover reading in or writing data here; see {ref}`data-read-and-write` for more on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is hugely indebted to the fantastic [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake Vanderplas. Remember, if you get stuck with **pandas**, there is brilliant [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) and a fantastic set of [introductory tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) on the **pandas** website. These notes are heavily indebted to those introductory tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter mainly uses the **pandas** and **numpy** packages. If you're running this code, you may need to install these packages, which you can do using either `conda install packagename` or `pip install packagename` on your computer's command line. If you're running this page in Google Colab, you can install new packages by running `!pip install packagename` in a new code cell but you will need to restart the Colab notebook for the change to take effect. There's a brief guide to installing packages in the Chapter on {ref}`code-preliminaries`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using tidy data\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, if you're working with tabular data, it's good to try and use a so-called 'tidy data' format. This is data with one observation per row, and one variable per column, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram showing tidy data](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidy data aren't going to be appropriate *every* time and in every case, but they're a really, really good default for tabular data. Once you use it as your default, it's easier to think about how to perform subsequent operations. Some plotting libraries (eg **plotnine**) take that your data are in tidy format as a given. And many operations that you can perform on dataframes (the objects that hold tabular data within many programming languages) are easier when you have tidy data. If you're writing out data to file to share, putting it in tidy format is a really good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, *getting* your messy dataset into a tidy format may take a bit of work... but we're about to enter the exciting world of coding for data analysis: the tools you'll see in the rest of this chapter will help you to 'wrangle' even the most messy of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that tidy data are great, and they are, one of standard data library **pandas**' advantages relative to other data analysis libraries is that it isn't *too* tied to tidy data and can navigate awkward non-tidy data manipulation tasks happily too."

    "![](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/_images/01_table_dataframe.svg)\n",

Keep in mind the question, \"what is the index doing in this operation\" for every process you apply to a **pandas** dataframe and you won't go far wrong.\n",
