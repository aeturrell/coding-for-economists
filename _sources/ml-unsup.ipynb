    "To cluster data is to use a set of high-dimensional features to create a grouping wherein data points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than data points in distinct clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When might you wish to cluster? You can use clusters to get informative fixed effects based on other data. You can use clustering to create features for (supervised) machine learning. You can use clusters to help you understand different types of (groups of) data in your sample. Some more applied examples are: market segmentation, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with much of the API, there are two ways to use the clustering algorithms found in the **scikit-learn** package: the first implements the fit method to learn clusters on training data; the second is a function, that, given training data, returns an array of integer labels corresponding to the different clusters. As ever, there are `fit`, `fit_tranform`, and `transform` methods so that you can create clusters, create and allocate data to clusters, or just allocate data to existing clusters, respectively."

    "## Dimensional Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensional reduction is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data. Reducing dimensions can be helpful because of the curse of dimensionality and the sparsity of data in higher dimensions making it either computationally infeasible or perhaps impossible to run standard algorithms. It can also be helpful to summarise and visualise high-dimensional information in a *continuous* way (rather than the discrete way offered by clustering).\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor analysis is one type of dimensional reduction that may already be familiar to you as an economist. This is available in **scikit-learn**, along with a range of [other reduction algorithms](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#decompositions).\n",
