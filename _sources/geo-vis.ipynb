Sometimes you want to incorporate other features into your map, or just give some context to where things are beyond the boundaries of your polygons. Enter different basemaps, ie different backgrounds for you to draw the geospatial data on top of.\n",

It's easiest to illustrate with an example; let's use Wales again. But the whole point is that we can combine this map with other things, so we'll do a few points to show where some places are: LLandudno, Cardiff, Rhyll, Newport, and St Davids. St Davids is the smallest city in Britain, and we'll make the points proportional to population, so you may have to squint to see it!"
