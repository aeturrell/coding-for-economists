    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to run linear regressions with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running this code (either by copying and pasting it, or by downloading it using the icons at the top of the page), you may need to install the packages it uses first. There's a brief guide to installing packages in the chapter on {ref}`code-preliminaries`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this chapter will rely on [**pyfixest**](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest) and we are indebted to [Alexander Fischer](https://github.com/s3alfisc) for his efforts in bringing a convenient and flexible way to absorb high dimensional fixed effects to Python via **pyfixest**. Some of the material in this chapter follows [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/)'s excellent notes and the [Library of Statistical Translation](https://lost-stats.github.io/).\n",

    "Greek letters, like $\\beta$, are the truth and represent parameters. Modified Greek letters are an estimate of the truth, for example $\\hat{\\beta}$. Sometimes Greek letters will stand in for vectors of parameters. Most of the time, upper case Latin characters such as $X$ will represent random variables (which could have more than one dimension). Lower case letters from the Latin alphabet denote realised data, for instance $x$ (which again could be multi-dimensional).  Modified Latin alphabet letters denote computations performed on data, for instance $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i} x_i$ where $n$ is number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression can be used to *estimate* the parameters of certain types of model, most typically models of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This generic model says that the value of an outcome variable $y$ is a linear function of one or more input predictor variables $x_i$, where the $x_i$ could be transforms of original data. But the above equation is a platonic ideal, what we call a data generating process (DGP). OLS allows us to recover *estimates* of the parameters of the model , i.e. to find $\\hat{\\beta_i}$ and to enable us to write an estimated model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} \\cdot x_1 + \\hat{\\beta_2} \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation can also be expressed in matrix form as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = x'\\cdot \\hat{\\beta} + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x' = (1, x_1, \\dots, x_{n})'$ and $\\hat{\\beta} = (\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1}, \\dots, \\hat{\\beta_{n}})$.\n",

    "Given data $y_i$ stacked to make a vector $y$ and $x_{i}$ stacked to make a matrix $X$, this can be solved for the coefficients $\\hat{\\beta}$ according to\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gauss-Markov Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "To be sure that the estimates of these parameters are the *best linear unbiased estimate*, a few conditions need to hold: the Gauss-Markov conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $y$ is a linear function of the $\\beta_i$\n",
    "2. $y$ and the $x_i$ are randomly sampled from the population.\n",
    "3. There is no perfect multi-collinearity of variables.\n",
    "4. $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon | x_1, \\dots, x_n) = 0$ (unconfoundedness)\n",
    "5. $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon | x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\sigma^2$ (homoskedasticity)\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)-(4) also guarantee that OLS estimates are unbiased and $\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\beta}_i) = \\beta_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic linear model requires a 6th assumption; that $\\epsilon \\thicksim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of regression coefficients depends on what their units are to begin with, but you can always work it out by differentiating both sides of the model equation with respect to the $x_i$. For example, for the first model equation above\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_i} = \\beta_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so we get the interpretation that $\\beta_i$ is the rate of change of y with respect to $x_i$. If $x_i$ and $y$ are in levels, this means that a unit increase in $x_i$ is associated with a $\\beta_i$ units increase in $y$. If the right-hand side of the model is $\\ln x_i$ then we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_i} = \\beta_i \\frac{1}{x_i} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with some abuse of notation, we can rewrite this as $\\partial y = \\beta_i \\partial x_i/x_i$, which says that a percent change in $x_i$ is associated with a $\\beta_i$ unit change in $y$. With a logged $y$ variable, it's a percent change in $x_i$ that is associated with a percent change in $y$, or $\\partial y/y = \\beta_i \\partial x_i/x_i$ (note that both sides of this equation are unitless in this case). Finally, another example that is important in practice is that of log differences, eg $y = \\beta_i (\\ln x_i - \\ln x_i')$. Again, we will abuse notation and say that this case may be represented as $\\partial y = \\beta_i (\\partial x_i/x_i - \\partial x_i'/x_i')$, i.e. the difference in two percentages, a *percentage point* change, in $x_i$ is associated with a $\\beta_i$ unit change in $y$."

    "## The formula API explained\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will have seen `~` separates the left- and right-hand sides of the regression. `+` computes a set union, which will also be familiar from the examples above (ie it includes two terms as long as they are distinct). `-` computes a set difference; it adds the set of terms to the left of it while removing any that appear on the right of it. As we've seen, `a*b` is a short-hand for `a + b + a:b`, with the last term representing the interaction. `/` is short hand for `a + a:b`, which is useful if, for example `b` is nested within `a`, so it doesn't make sense to control for `b` on its own. Actually, the `:` character can interact multiple terms so that `(a + b):(d + c)` is the same as `a:c + a:d + b:c + b:d`. `C(a)` tells statsmodels to treat `a` as a categorical variable that will be included as a fixed effect. Finally, as we saw above with powers, you can also pass in vectorised functions, such as `np.log()` and `np.power()`, directly into the formulae.\n",
    "\n",
    "One gotcha with the formula API is ensuring that you have sensible variable names in your dataframe, i.e. ones that do *not* include whitespace or, to take a really pathological example, have the name 'a + b' for one of the columns that you want to regress on. You can dodge this kind of problem by passing in the variable name as, for example, `Q(\"a + b\")` to be clear that the *column name* is anything within the `Q(\"...\")`."

That is, each element in `sw()` is sequentially, and separately, added to the formula. If you use `sw0` in lieu of `sw`, then the model `y ~ x1` would also be estimated: the `0` in the name implies that the model without any stepwise element will also be estimated. This explains how to use `sw` and `sw0`.\n",
