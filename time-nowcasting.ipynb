    "# Introduction to Nowcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowcasting is the prediction of economic indicators in the present, the very near future, and the very recent past—usually in a context where there is a lag in collecting and compiling information on that economic indicators and only partial information is available. For GDP, it can take over a year after the end of the so-called reference period for the final version of the data to be released. The two times you'll most often hear about nowcasting are in the context of the weather and GDP, two variables that people care deeply about!\n",
    "\n",

    "We need to begin with some definitions. A *reference period* is the time period of interest to the nowcast, ie the time period for which you would like to estimate a data point. The *data vintage* is the time when the data were issued, and this could be before or after the reference period—indeed, for data that are revised, it can be some time *after* the reference period. Finally, the *frequency* is how often reference periods occur. For nowcasting GDP, the frequency is typically quarterly.\n",

    "Nowcasting is, in many ways, more complicated than forecasting. With forecasting, it's often the case that the *information set*, $\\Omega$, that you're using is fixed at a point in time (say, at time $t-1$), and you plug that information into a model, $f$, to try and predict your target variable, $y$, at $y_{t}$. With nowcasting, the problem becomes *dynamic*. We could be at $t-1$, $t$, or even $t+1$ (and anything inbetween) but we still want to use the *same* model to nowcast the value of $y$ at $t$! This is a tall order for any model; it has to cover input data that are changing over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nowcasts should be able to be constructed *whenever* new data are available; that is whenever the *information set*, $\\Omega$, is updated. And this could happen several times through the nowcasting period (in forecast, nowcast, or backcasting periods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowcasts have to deal with two particular challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nowcasts should be able to deal with mixed frequency data, so as to take information that is released between and within reference periods.\n",
    "- Nowcasts should be able to deal with \"ragged edges\" in the data; that is, different variables in the information set have different release frequencies so making a nowcast at any point in time will inevitably collect an information set that has some data missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example of the new data that arrive during the period of operation of a nowcast (and these two challenges), let's imagine we are trying to nowcast quarterly GDP but that every month there is a survey of growth expectations and every three weeks on a Monday there is a release on sales (which has some predictive power for GDP). And then let's imagine we are trying to take a nowcast."
