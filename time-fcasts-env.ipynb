    "# Forecasting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we're going to do a tour of forecasting exercises: that is, the set of operations, like slicing up time, that you might need to do when performing a forecast. Although there will be some code in this chapter, we're mostly laying the theoretical groundwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some definitions. Features, or regressors, are labelled by $k = 0, \\dots, K-1$ and time by $t = 0, \\dots, T-1$. Note that this means there are $T$ time periods and $K$ features. We'll label different slices of time (or equivalently models trained on different data) by an index $\\mu$ beginning from $\\mu=1$, and we'll give these slices of time different labels: IS for in-sample and OS for out-of-sample. $f_\\mu$ is the model trained on the $\\mu$th set of in-sample data. The target variable (the number we are trying to forecast) is $\\left\\{y_{t+h}\\right\\}_{t=0}^{t=T-1}$, where $h$ is the number of time steps ahead we wish to forecast. Let $\\left\\{x_{tk}\\right\\}_{t=0}^{t=T-1}$ represent feature (or regressor) $k$. In general, a forecast implies $h>0$ (otherwise we're doing a nowcast).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first do some setup for the rest of the chapter. We'll be using the **numpy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **plotnine** packages."

    "## Two Period Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple forecast you can imagine is if we have two periods (each of which may be made up of more than one value of $t$). The important thing is that the $t$ in the first, \"in-sample\" period do not overlap with the $t$ in the second, \"out-of-sample\" period. That's because we *only want to use information in the in-sample period to forecast the out-of-sample period*. There are some cases where you may want to \"forecast\" the in-sample period, but if you're interested in the real-world performance of your forecast, this is the setup you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this world of a single in-sample period and a single out-of-sample period, $\\mu=1$, and we could get drop that notation and just use IS and OS. But we'll leave it in to make the contrast with what's to come clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is to use a model, $f = f_{\\mu=1}$, that is trained to predict $\\{y_{t+h}, t:\\mu_{\\text{IS}}=1\\}$ using $\\{x_{tk}, t:\\mu_{\\text{IS}}=1\\}$ so that it can do an out-of-sample forecast of $\\{y_{t+h}, t:\\mu_\\text{OS}=1\\}$ using $\\{x_{tk}, t:\\mu_{\\text{OS}}=1\\}$.

    "## Transforms of Series in Forecasting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you often *don't* want to throw a time series straight into a forecast. This is for lots of reasons: stationarity, producing the best performing model, the ranges that certain models will accept, and so on. Instead you want to transform the data first using a general transform $T\\colon X\\to Z$. But when in a forecasting situation, extra care must be taken not to let information leak from the period that a model is *not* supposed to know about. For example, a forecast that is supposed to be out-of-sample, ie it is forecasting a time period $t''$, should not be able to see any information about $X_{t''}$ or $y_{t''}$. Why is this a problem when doing transforms? Because many transforms of, say, a scalar $x_t$ depend on $x_{t'}; \\: t\\neq t'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's take an example of a common transform with no dependence on any other data: $T(x_t) = \\ln(x_t)$. In this case we do not need to worry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example that's quite common is $T(x_t) = \\frac{x_t}{x_{t-1}}$. Again, this transform shouldn't cause us much concern because it only depends on *past* information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now turn to more tricky transforms. Let's imagine we wish to normalise the data, ie take\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(x_t) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{x}} \\left( x_t - \\frac{\\sum_{t'} x_{t'}}{\\sum_{t'} t'} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ${\\displaystyle \\sigma_{x}={\\sqrt {{\\frac {1}{\\sum_{t'} x_t'}} \\sum_{t'}\\left(x_{t'}-{\\frac{\\sum_{t''} x_{t''}}{\\sum_{t''} t''}}\\right)^{2}}}}$. The summations are over *all* values of $t$, but this means that $T(x_t)$ has 'seen' $x_{t'}$, $t'>t$ and $t'$ may well be in the out-of-sample slice. This could be a problem: imagine that the mean or standard deviation changes significantly because of a crisis. Being privy to that shift may make it easier to predict post-crisis values of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix information leakage due to transforms, we redefine transformations to make them a function of the windows being used in the forecasting exercise. For an expanding window transform of a variable $x_t$, this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_{\\mu}^e (\\vec{x}) = T_{\\mu}^e (\\vec{x}; I_\\mu^e(\\vec{x})) = \\frac{\\vec{x} - \\langle{I_\\mu^e(\\vec{x})\\rangle}}{\\sigma_{I_\\mu^e(\\vec{x})}} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\langle x \\rangle$ is the mean of $\\{x_t\\}$. So now the transform is dependent on the *type* of forecasting exercise, the *period* ($\\mu$) of the forecasting exercise, and the *input data*. A similar definition applies to the rolling window configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we apply this in code? That part's easy: we can re-use the slice functions we made earlier, namely `in_sample_block_r` for in-sample rolling windows and `in_sample_block_e` for out-of-sample expanding windows. A more general way of avoiding data leakage, especially when there are many transformations, is to use **scikit-learn**'s [pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html#pipeline) functionality.\n"

    "## Data Vintage and the Real-Time Information Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another complication if you want an accurate assessment of how good your forecast will be in the real world: some data, and especially economic data, are revised over time. But to give an *accurate* picture of how well your forecast approach would have done at the time, you need to use only the data that would have been available at the time the forecast was made: you need to use real-time data vintages. Typically, one only considers different vintages of regressors--but target variables change too and this is worth bearing in mind if you are using lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few labelling operations help us use everything defined so far in this chapter in the real-time data vintage case. We introduce an extra label for vintage, $\\tau$, which says when the data were released. Features are now given by $x_{tk\\tau}$. Assuming that vintages are improving over time, models will always be trained using the most up-to-date vintage available up to that time so that a forecast made at $t$ uses the highest available value of $\\tau$ for which $\\tau \\leq t$, eg $\\tau = \\max{ \\{ \\tau' | \\tau' \\leq t \\}}$."
