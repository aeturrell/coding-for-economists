    "## Linear Mixed Effects Regressions (LMER)\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear mixed models are an extension of simple linear models to allow both fixed and random effects. It's worth us having a quick recap of random effects before we dig into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed vs Random Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is going to come up in this chapter, it's worth having a quick review of the difference between fixed and random effects in regression-based models. There's a bit of disagreement about what people really mean when they say \"fixed effects\" or \"random effects\", so let's define them clearly here.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Random effects are estimated with partial pooling, while fixed effects are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? Well, technically, if an effect is assumed to be a realised value of a random variable, it is called a random effect. We could say that, in frequentist land (where parameters have true values), a single fixed effect model might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\gamma\\cdot d\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, which could be whether an individual belongs to, say, group 0 or group 1 and $\\gamma$ is a coefficient that is to be estimated. $\\gamma$ has a single \"true\" value, and we can admire the value of $\\hat{\\gamma}$ in a regression table once we have done our estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, even in a frequentist model, random effects are allowed to vary: they are drawn from a distribution (or, more accurately, their deviations from the true value are drawn from a distribution). This might be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{i}= w_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and it could be that, instead of a group-specific intercept as in the fixed effects model above, the intercept can take a *range of values* depending on the individual. Although it's not always true, another way of thinking about this is that fixed effects are constant across individuals while random effects can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's this business about partial pooling? Imagine we have a situation where one group is under-sampled relative to the other groups. With few data points, we may not be able to precisely estimate fixed effects. However, partial pooling means that, if you do have few data points within a group, the group effect estimate can be partially based on the more abundant data from other groups. Random effects can provide a good compromise between estimating an effect by completely pooling all groups, which masks group-level variation, and estimating an effect for all groups completely separately, which could give imprecise estimates for low-sample groups. For example, when estimating means using a random effects approach, subgroup means are allowed to deviate a bit from the mean of the larger group, but not by an arbitrary amount—those deviations follow a distribution, typically a Gaussian (aka Normal) distribution. That's where the \"random\" in random effects comes from: the deviations of subgroups from a \"parent group\" follow the distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb when thinking about how many different categories should exist for a variable to get the random, rather than fixed, effects treatment is that there should be more than 5 or 6 levels at a minimum in order to apply random effects—fewer than this and it's hard to estimate the variance around the central estimate. Because you could potentially precisely estimated a fixed effect if you had lots of samples in those 5 or 6 levels, you're more likely to reach for random effects when you have fewer samples per class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random effects are the extension of this partial pooling technique to a wide range of situations: including multiple predictors, mixed continuous and categorical variables, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, taken from a [forum post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4700/what-is-the-difference-between-fixed-effect-random-effect-and-mixed-effect-mode) by Paul of MassMutual, suppose you want to estimate average US household income by ZIP code. You have a large dataset containing observations of household incomes and ZIP codes. Some ZIP codes are well represented in the dataset, but others have only a couple of households.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your initial model you would most likely take the mean income in each ZIP. This will work well when you have lots of data for all ZIPs, but the estimates for your poorly sampled ZIPs will suffer from high variance. You can mitigate this by using a shrinkage estimator (aka partial pooling), which will push extreme values towards the mean income across all ZIP codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how much shrinkage/pooling should you do for a particular ZIP? Intuitively, it should depend on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many observations you have in that ZIP\n",
    "2. How many observations you have overall\n",
    "3. The individual-level mean and variance of household income across all ZIP codes\n",
    "4. The group-level variance in mean household income across all ZIP codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you model ZIP code as a random effect, the mean income estimate in all ZIP codes will be subjected to a statistically well-founded shrinkage, taking into account all of these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random effects models automatically handle 4, the variability estimation, for all random effects in the model. This is useful, as it would be hard to do manually. Having accounted for (1)–(4), a random effects model is able to determine the appropriate shrinkage for low-sample groups. It can also handle much more complicated models with many different predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mixed effects models** are models that combine random and fixed effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with Random Effects\n",
