Strack and colleagues reported that participants rated cartoons as more funny when the participants held a pen in their teeth (inducing a smile) than when they held a pen between their lips (inducing a pout). This outcome variable is recorded as `\"value\"` in the data. The article has been cited over 1,400 times, and has been influential in popularising the view that affective experiences and outward expressions of affective experiences can both influence each other (instead of the relationship being a one-way street from experience to expression). In 2016, a Registered Replication Report (RRR) led by Wagenmakers and colleagues attempted to replicate Study 1 from Strack, Martin, & Stepper (1988) in 17 independent experiments comprising over 2,500 participants.\n",
